i was actually thinking about this back in the day when mccain first saw obama he couldve thought this young man could be a fantastic president so he got together with a young obama and began speaking to him on what he needed to do and what they both needed to do this was right after bush being reelected in 2004 mind you kerry and mccain worked together years ago on the powmia acts chances are mccain thought he could angle kerry into office because of his intellectualism he didnt count on kerrys rigid lack of charisma so he found and helped a young man add his name to some good bills do some good work in the senate all under the table of course and then in 2004 helped obama get the speech that rocketed him into stardom they then sat together and said in 2008 we will run against each other and mccain made a vow that if he couldnt be president he would make sure that someone with a resolute heart would be someone he could respect and he realized the only way to do this was to destroy his image and destroy the image of the goprepublicans in such a way that only the fanatical base would stay and thus we arrive at today theyve orchestrated this in a way so mccain picks an idiot vp one with no foreign policy experience that will excite that small percentage base and alienate the rest obama picks biden who is very intelligent mccain and obama realize that such a contrast will paint palin as the antiintellectual she is and will excite both the democratic bases and exclude moderates from the red states this is my dream at least i really dont like what mccain has become because if he has always been like this then i was blinded in 2000 well heres to hoping that the two men debating and speaking with each other and running against each other are men of honor and sacrifice for the country and for the people of this once great union,politics
actually i agree with akatherder except i do put the blame on bush and republicans including mccain for the economy with regard to deregulation of the finance industry and tax cuts for the wealthy i also blame them for the war in iraq and those deaths which has just about caused us to lose the more legitimate war in afghanistan i blame them for cronyism i blame them for dismantling environmental protection i blame them for undercutting science i blame them for not providing an open government i blame them for excessive corporatism i blame them for being against network neutrality im sure that these criticisms dont cover it but its a start so what do i look for from a democratic obama victory stopping most if not all of the above abuses and hopefully undoing them and this being driven by a man with integrity and intellect,politics

mormonism has been closely associated in public discourse with polygamy in the 1830s joseph smith jr instituted a form of polygamy in which one man would have several wives but not the reverse referred to as plural marriage which brigham young promoted after the lds churchs move to the utah territory according to his own statements joseph smith jr was more than a little uneasy at facing the institution of plural marriage and said that he did so only after being warned through subsequent divine revelation that he should begin the practice or be destroyedthe lds church also teaches that its adherents are members of the house of israel,politics

i dont think so not this time the difference is in where the new lines have been drawn and what each side has come to symbolize for the opposition its not just the same old fistfight between two virtually identical guys this year because of the rhetoric and tone of the election its much more personal if mccain wins on the basis of rigged machines i believe there will be serious trouble ironically though because so many people have been thinking the same thing riots and civil disturbances might become less likely and the anger and passions built up may be mitigated into truly effective campaigns to oust the administration if we could organize to bring a single man this far against these odds we could certainly organize enough to overturn an invalid presidency our constitution provided well for that because were already facing the potential outcome honestly it might make us redirect obviously selfharmful energy into a more precise strike at the perpetrators of the coup so no we wont accept it and while there may or may not be riots there will be enough anger to seriously undermine any attempt at actually governing that way,politics
okay whats the message my gifted opponent concedes i show leadership so vote for me wtf why not just send obama the money with a different tag line this really could have been an obama ad he did all the talking and sounded wise and presidential so now a here is facetious theory that mccain always planned to throw this fight  he was in the tank for obama for day one not true of course but at this point i would say that mccain looks better were it true one mistake after another after another my sister a democratic operative says the palin nomination clinched it for obama why didnt mccain pick joe liberman mentioned in this ad as his running mate or if he had to run a woman liz dole he might have won or stood a fighting chance and no show joe sam the skinhead unlicensed plumber puhleeese my theory i think the three stooges are secretly doing his pr nyaa ah ah,politics

in recent days john mccain has attacked barack obama for being an academic who is out of touch with ordinary americans at the same time mccains running mate sarah palin told a crowd in greensboro north carolina that she loves visiting small towns because that was the real america upon hearing this i have just one question to ask when did ignorance become something to aspire to in this country this is the country that invented the airplane the mass produced automobile the computer satellite communications and the laser just to name a few our movies music and media are our number one export american colleges are so well regarded that students from all over the world come to this country to study i mean my god we are the country that put men on the moon in nine years nine years that is unheard of in the whole history of the human race think about the fact that from the first flight of the airplane to landing men on the moon only 66 years had passed thats just one human lifetime so how is it that joe sixpack or for that matter joe the plumber is somehow now a more desirable ideal than someone who puts themselves through law school and goes on to teach constitutional law for eight years if someones going to be running this country i for one hope that they have at least read the constitution and the bill of rights with the challenges that we face as a nation a massive federal deficit lax financial regulation and a broken health care system to name a few shouldnt we want the smartest people we have regardless of party affiliation to be coming up with solutions to these problems then give it to the joe sixpacks to implement the fixes and see what works or do we somehow think that ordinary americans are going to come up with the brilliant answers that will enable us to climb out of this gigantic mess that were all in i sometimes wonder if all of this antiintellectualism is driven by the presumption that educated people are less likely to be godfearing than the average american while it is true that people with college degrees are more likely to question established systems of belief and less likely to pursue the kind of christian conservatism that is in vogue today that doesnt mean that they have a predisposition to be antigod or antiamerican and isnt it ironic that some of the most conservative and wealthiest americans are also some the most educated  after all president george w bush has an mba from harvard it is my personal belief that god grants each of us certain talents and abilities but these are only potentials so unless we work hard to hone and develop our innate skills they will lie fallow if we do work hard then god will uphold his part of the bargain by insuring that opportunities come our way to not only further our talents but to use them for the greater good therefore we glorify god by making the most of the gifts he has given us and by this measure god despises waste if someone has the ability to become a doctor or to write a great symphony or find a cure for breast cancer we should as a people be doing everything we can encourage and enable them because if that person fails to realize their god given gifts then everyone in america looses and we will never know what might have been people forget that the founding fathers of our country were not for the most part ordinary americans they were doctors lawyers and military officers  almost all of them wealthy land owners but they understood the plight of the common man and had the wisdom and foresight to craft a government that would treat every man equal under the law ignorance is not something to be aspired to it should be combated at every opportunity each of us should strive to discover the limits of our human potential after all who wants to live an unfulfilled life,politics
i tend towards thinking that the republican party realized that the gaggle of idiots that were leading the primaries early couldnt possibly be elected so they approached mccain and made him an offer he couldnt refuse well make you the republican nominee and you toe the hard right conservative hawk line mccain at 72 years old knowing that this would be his swan song sold his soul to the devil he rocketed back from nowhere in the primary season and here we are hes a different man now than he was running in 2000 he used to be lucid and reasonable though i disagreed with him on many things he used to answer questions from the press until the press got tired and went home in 2000 had he been nominated he would have won the presidency fairly his positions then were far and away most attractive to a majority of americans not unfortunately to a majority of republicans this is it for mccain and he knows it hes said a lot of things through gritted teeth because he knows hes given up on himself in order to take his last possible shot at history the really unfortunate thing is that if hed run on his own ideals he would probably have still gotten the nomination and would be giving obama a much stronger run the nation would be having a real discussion about issues now instead of a circus of followers for each candidate and a tragic comedy sideshow in palin i pity you john mccain,politics

america are unhappy and antisocial citizens whose ancestors were granted refuge in north america in the eighteenth century witness the testimony of the king of dahomey who ruled much of the congo basin who assumed the throne of that nation at age eighteen in about 1820 and who died the same day as queen victoria in 1900 making him one of the longest ruling monarchs in history the only interview he ever granted was to henry morton stanley in about 1870 he assured stanley that every person over four years of age within the entire congo basin regularly ate human flesh social infractions of any kind hooliganism or indeed casting ones eyes upon the king guaranteed a one way trip to the town butcher the victims were auctioned in the marketplaces a piece at a time thus a customer would purchase a leg for instance or a hand or the liver and would receive a token then when the whole body was sold the victim would be dispatched and the tokens exchanged for his body parts it was the refugees from cannibalism that made up the bulk of african immigration into america all a ship had to do was anchor anywhere in the congo delta and they would swarm aboard a situation that continues to this day consider the spectacle of a couple of hundred battalions of somali tribesmen rampaging across rural north america while the african americans rampage thru the cities like they did in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in new orleans killing and rounding up and interning the whites in the camps a well planned military operation would be able to immobilize most of north america in a very short time anybody who thinks that i am a racist should know that i am not indeed many of my best girlfriends have been black in matters of love a stiff prick is the best bridge

youre right i could have been clearer but then i may not have had peoples attention enough to have them read my point ill just say that before people get emotionally caught up in the fervor of electing a grand new president there should first be an understanding about where their wealth truly comes from and how to nurture it how does the paper they trade affect everyday life and how is it that something of such importance without tangible value food shelter medicines precious metals etc exist people stop looking at life beyond their comfort zone because theyre too busy when the reason why theyre so busy is because others are taking advantage of that complacency this soontobe president whom im inclined to believe is heavensent by the way some people praise him is beyond scrutiny the illusion that money has value is what has kept the economy strong for so long and the world is awakening to the fact that it barely represents the smallest fraction of the value it has promised he hasnt addressed this increasingly troublesome fact which im afraid will be lost should the many people blindly supporting obama fail to recognize that hes only a man and has great potential to do harm if left unchecked and in the public eye for matters of arguable importance and no this is tldr,politics

i havent seen any redditors supporting mccain for any reasons that make sense almost all of the mccain support i see comes down to william ayers fears that obama will raise taxes and fears of obamas inexperience the reason that cupcake is so fucking awesome is that hes actually gets obamas message its not about who he is the color of his skin or smear attacks which obama has had more than ample opportunity to go after but for the most part he hasnt but its about what he wants to do with our help of course maybe the reason that i havent seen any intelligent support for mccain is because its already downmodded into oblivion before i get there if thats the case its a damn shame i personally dont down or upvote because i agree with a person but rather because of the content and presentation of the comment edit for example look at the mccain08 comment that currently is residing directly underneath this tree of comments for me gtfucking idiot thinks obama is for the little man theres nothing there you cant go against the hivemind with just a curse word and some harsh language and expect people to agree with you if he had backed it up and been respectful about it people might be open to his message see thats really what obamas campaign has been about hes got a message thats different than our last eight years hes going at it respectfully and it certainly looks like people are listening fairly intently mccain and palin seem to be tossing insult after insult followed by smear after smear and theyre losing states that havent voted democratic since 1964,politics

you are right about one thing true christians are for life no true christian wants war but anyone with a brain realizes when the world has evil dictators in it who have the capacity to make war and oppress others sometimes it requires you to go to war to defend those who would be victimized by the bully dictators or especially to protect your own country from those who want to annihilate you christians are not for murder if you are protecting your country in war than you are following the order of your government it says in the bible to follow your authority that god has put in place but above all follow him war cannot be avoided in some circumstances while abortion can always be avoided by doing the humane thinggiving birth now for the bible support psalm 1391316 describes the lord knitting me together in my mothers womb and then describes how god knew all my days before there was one of them look it up yourself if you dont believe me then in deuteronomy 3019 it says gti call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live gt notice he says choose life that you and your seed meaning your offspring may live then in for capitol punishment for capitol crimes you can go all the way back to the first book of the bible gen 96 whoso shedding mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man and for most liberals who claim jesus would never support war why did he say he who has no sword let him sell his cloak and buy one jesus was not a pacifist as most of you believe he even got violent himself on one occasion he saw all the merchandising going on in the temple he left made a whip and then came back and cleared the temple overturning tables and i am sure he cracked the whip possibly on the backs of some people who were taking advantage of those who had to buy sacrifices this was a premeditated and deliberate act on jesus part so no he was not a pacifist especially when it came to bullies taking advantage of poor people see john 21417,politics

i guess women thus lesbians arent into debauchery as a rule and a lifestyle and a value not to say there wasnt a time i was happy to meet a few that seemed to the women i did know that felt the more men the more often the better i and others viewed as damaged to some degree it just didnt look healthy and it wasnt i dont think all men would be as promiscuous as gay men if they could but youre right the women wouldnt go with it if they did i mean after your 50th woman and your first 1000 sexual encounters what do you expect to find different i loved my women but i cant imagine digging anonymous sex with women glory holes cruising them in public bathrooms sex in the bushes etc gay men apparently do expect to find something worth staying on the hunt for and im talking men in their 40s 50s 60s and beyond im sorry to me thats different enough that i dont wish to see marriage stretched to include that value system marriage is about commitment and child rearing neither of those values do well with endless promiscuity which is a value for many gay men there is no such value among married heterosexuals i dont think marriage would cut down on casual sex these guys are gonna roll married or not and im fine with that go for it but dont take the heterosexual ideal of marriage for your own if your lifestyle honors promiscuity and the gay lifestyle does honor and respect promiscuity ive certainly never heard it criticized beyond perhaps have safe sex but never heard a gay organization or leader say commitment is the ideal we should strive for thats too straight a value no its sex is good in all its forms whenever wherever thats just too different from what heterosexuals do to say were the same and should share the institution of marriage i guess im the one to decide because theres a ballot proposition before me and i have to make a choice it affects me because i dont want what i view as a promiscuous section of society entering into a relationship that was formed to value monogamy and has historically never in any society anywhere accepted homosexuality the definition of marriage a union between man and woman shouldnt be changed to include another type of coupling just because they want to whats next triads children getting married btw it is the societys place to judge what a marriage is and should be not activist judges ignoring the will of the people and established definition society has rendered over thousands of years because their philosophy is different from the general population its not enough gay people suddenly feel they should be married it is and has been a union of man and woman let gay people join together but call it something else its not exactly analogous but it reminds me of the betrayal of the catholic church by homosexual men i know some people call them pedophiles to distance homosexuals from this betrayal but they were preteen and teenage boys that were abused not toddlers who are pedophiles victims of choice these men betrayed their faith to satisfy their urges they should have never been priests and in a place alone with children sure you can have a heterosexual abuse here and there but never on the scale that happened with the church and homosexual priests i can assure you the church no matter how much homosexual men want to be priests will not bow to their rights and allow themselves and the children to be victimized again my admittedly nonexpert opinion is that the gay culture values anything goes between consenting adults and no behavior is bad or offlimits this simply does not fit in an institution that has a religious heritage and history and was structured at least in part to provide a stable environment for children if youre rocking and celebrating sex in all its forms and permutations all the time why would you want to be married true or not this is the image the gay male community has carved out for itself check out gay pride paradesall about half naked young buff hotties and fetishists celebrating sexuality there is no heterosexual counterpart reason being most heterosexuals lives dont revolve around sex at least after 25 or so and if it isnt true the leaders of the gay community should start denouncing debauchery instead of affirming it or wincing and looking the other way dont hold your breath on that happening itd be betraying the movement i guess again i have no problem with legal rights to property visitation etc but marriage historically is one man one woman and ideally a true and forever love there are exceptions i suppose but i see hedonism as a value that sadly gay men celebrate and are known for if i were a lesbian i guess id be pissed at the image thats been established by the guys the weirdness of it the clumsiness of the attempt to be absorbed in marriage is revealed in the terminology two guys get married whos the wife hi id like you to meet my wife joe theres a reason and history behind husband and wife even the language of the society cant handle it which is indicative of the problem for the society at large i know you feel differently then i do and i can see why your arguments are not without merit i appreciate that youre able to hear a different opinion without hurling the homophobe bigot etc card i guess well find out soon how the rest of the state thinks,politics

gtwe dont know in which direction the destination is so we have to set off in all directions at once gti do not think that a long term thinker can provide answers gtsmall steps in many random directions will make the path obvious what you say about the small steps essentially narrowing the paths i also believe in although the method i wish to go about it is through an exercising of my human rights on this land for preservation donating to local charities and funds and understanding the impacts that the use of my dollars will have on populations that i cannot see yet still read about such as what i read about the congo not but a few days ago and insight on the control asserted there but i wont go into that anyway i tend to believe that these small steps in random directions becoming larger are what communities and municipalities are there for to support and be supported by each other and to have positive actions radiate positive influence for instance no matter where i move to or where i have lived i donate only to local causes yet try to consider when consumerism impacts international peoples for some sacrificing plastic bags at grocery stores for reusable ones are their thing for others its efforts such as forgoing chocolate because of the death toll associated with harvesting of cocoa i fall undecided somewhere between those two at least until i can have a clear understanding of whether my single step will create a ripple p gtits the everyday achievements failures loses and gains on the smallest of scales are what makes us whilst were sat on our backsides philosophizing and worrying about were the next generations energy is going to come from we would be better off going outside and doing stuff im lucky that i have a job that lets me solve difficult but small problems for people i move no mountains but clients are grateful to have the molehill shifted we really do think along the same lines i just seem to be the person who has yet to make up their mind on the whole moral dilemma my argument to this is that the temporary relief is not an approach to any sustainability it is very gratifying to help someone lift a weight off their shoulders but to me that still appears to be treating the symptom and not the illness if our work in the system does tends towards sustainable abundance which is what i imagine any worthwhile technological advances should be doing rather than predatory scarcity then how could all these machines and aids actually be decreasing the value of human labor for instance i still remember seeing that old colorless ad that theorizes in the future man will have to work only two hour days with all the comfort that technology would afford  now in this day that effect would be argued as a purely destructive force because as you say our achievements failures losses and gains are what makes us i believe its our exchanges with other lives that affect us and mold us first and our work is but a strong influence as it is all weve ever known what if those achievements were made not at a metaphorical swordpoint of i must earn my keep constantly and everyday often pressing the breaking point or i cant eat or rest in relative comfort but from the standpoint of i have the food the home the leisure and all the necessities i could ask for at a fraction of yesteryears cost because of an overall energy and resource surplus encouraged by technology rather than encroached on by it our personal triumphs or molehills you move will always provide the same feeling when you and those you do it for can appreciate your work but i can attest and i hope you can too that sharing your labour of love as opposed to selling it for necessity is far more gratifying and generates more positive competition when we have the time to observe as opposed to worry sometimes we well i see doors that i never saw before and would like to explore just in case this dialogue would have you think im lazy ive been working my fair share of 1214 hour days for months straight with comfortable living conditions and proud bags under my eyes to show for it i have to admit though that the pride feels more superficial the more i learn about world events id almost describe the feeling i get when receiving money from my career as lecherous even though all i do is animate design and direct various cartoons anyway lpb im going to have to hit the sack plenty of work tomorrow and its getting late enough for me  great talkin with you about this its providing some insight and ill respond if you have anything else to continue with tomorrow peace and best of luck,politics

the indigenous conquered population the spartans were true fascists who predated the roman fascists who as well as imposing rigid and murderous conditions on themselves had one day every year when they could kill any of the non spartiate population s they saw fit they eventually killed themselves into extinction the single underlying factor in fascism is that de mobilized military personnel

unfortunately you dont have a choice until the system is changed to allow the viability of a third party or just simply the validity of a simple popular vote as long as the electoral college is the one calling the true shots in an election a candidate independent of the big two will never even be considered and that is why people who do vote for third party candidates are throwing their vote away your casting a vote for a third party candidate is like you an english speaking person yelling at a deaf man who speaks swahili they just dont get it,politics

gtmaybe its because it becomes a battlezone and they dont want many people running around holding large dark objects to avoid accidents that wouldnt explain why they let local press in then besides every military zone has members of the press theyll gladly risk their lives for a scoop and the idf doesnt have to protect them granted they have a track record of killing them of course were arguing semantics now the point is simple the idf controls the media and uses provocation to keep foreign media out of its operations but even when not partaking in one of their little security operations to cleanse the slums and refugee camps for jewish boys the idf keeps out the foreign press whats wrong afraid palestinians might tell their stories gtthe israeli media is hardly ever censored and even your video is showing that the story was published in it ah and even my video was published against the will of the idf you say its rarely censored however there is a zionist defending this censorship as if it were common practice self censorship he called it and he was quite comfortable with the notion rarely censored this video it should not have been allowed to air the idf banned this video from airing yet someone had had enough of this censorship and he put it to air anyway this was done against the will of the idf had the idf had its way you nor i would have gotten to see it there is no freedom of press in israel the military seems to have full control of it how many times has the idf had its way by far the majority gtisrael is short on cash the billions of us aid are only usable for us purchases and the german money is given to the families of holocaust survivors and holocaustrelated projects do you honestly expect me to believe that israel is home to the second largest number of start ups in the world its military is always getting stronger and the german government is giving billions of dollars were not talking millions here billions im sure between buying fighter jets and pretending theyre going to war with lebanon the idf could afford to fix a wall or two heck if they dont buy one fighter jet theyll have enough money to fix every wall and house they tear down in their little cleansing operations a signle iai kfir costs 45 million us they could rebuid every wall and house they tore down with solid gold with that kind of money you know why helping palestinians rebuild their homes after destroying them is not part of the idf program theyre not looking for peace theyre looking to provoke them by making them desperate so when they go on their killing rampages they can justify what they did because the palestinians protested i wasnt going to but what the heck gtthe idf soldiers there did not all spew antiarab rhetoric did you even listen to your own video there were two who were interviewed one talked of cleansing the place for jewish boys and the other casually remarked how it wasnt so bad as he adjusted his socks it wasnt so bad we only killed a mother of two young children then later tore down their wall and house apart but you are right not all of them showed how bigoted they were except the ones who actually said anything that is a weak argument i could just as well say everyone who is part of hammas who has not said they hate israel on camera does not actually hate israel i should also point out even the idf did not say they delayed the ambulance because of hammas they said it was a mistake as a military force no doubt the idf has its own medics and ambulances on hand why not use those resources another mistake it seems youre down to using a straw man argument,worldnews

understanding obama the making of a fuehrer by ali sina i must confess i was not impressed by sen barack obama from the first time i saw him at first i was excited to see a black candidate he looked youthful spoke well appeared to be confident  a wholesome presidential package i was put off soon not just because of his shallowness but also because there was an air of haughtiness in his demeanor that was unsettling his posture and his body language were louder than his empty words obamas speeches are unlike any political speech we have heard in american history never a politician in this land had such a quasi religious impact on so many people the fact that obama is a total incognito with zero accomplishment makes this inexplicable infatuation alarming obama is not an ordinary man he is not a genius in fact he is quite ignorant on most important subjects barack obama is a narcissist dr sam vaknin the author of the malignant self love also believes barack obama appears to be a narcissist vaknin is a world authority on narcissism he understands narcissism and describes the inner mind of a narcissist like no other person when he talks about narcissism everyone listens vaknin says that obamas language posture and demeanor and the testimonies of his closest dearest and nearest suggest that the senator is either a narcissist or he may have narcissistic personality disorder npd narcissists project a grandiose but false image of themselves jim jones the charismatic leader of peoples temple the man who led over 900 of his followers to cheerfully commit mass suicide and even murder their own children was also a narcissist david koresh charles manson joseph koni shoko asahara stalin saddam mao kim jong ill and adolph hitler are a few examples of narcissists of our time all these men had a tremendous influence over their fanciers they created a personality cult around themselves and with their blazing speeches elevated their admirers souls filled their hearts with enthusiasm and instilled in their minds a new zest for life they gave them hope they promised them the moon but alas invariably they brought them to their doom when you are a victim of a cult of personality you dont know it until it is too late one determining factor in the development of npd is childhood abuse obamas early life was decidedly chaotic and replete with traumatic and mentally bruising dislocations says vaknin mixedrace marriages were even less common then his parents went through a divorce when he was an infant two years old obama saw his father only once again before he died in a car accident then his mother remarried and obama had to relocate to indonesia  a foreign land with a radically foreign culture to be raised by a stepfather at the age of ten he was whisked off to live with his maternal white grandparents he saw his mother only intermittently in the following few years and then she vanished from his life in 1979 she died of cancer in 1995 one must never underestimate the manipulative genius of pathological narcissists they project such an imposing personality that it overwhelms those around them charmed by the charisma of the narcissist people become like clay in his hands they cheerfully do his bidding and delight to be at his service the narcissist shapes the world around himself and reduces others in his own inverted image he creates a cult of personality his admirers become his codependents narcissists have no interest in things that do not help them to reach their personal objective they are focused on one thing alone and that is power all other issues are meaningless to them and they do not want to waste their precious time on trivialities anything that does not help them is beneath them and do not deserve their attention if an issue raised in the senate does not help obama in one way or another he has no interest in it the present vote is a safe vote no one can criticize him if things go wrong why should he implicate himself in issues that may become controversial when they dont help him personally those issues are unworthy by their very nature because they are not about him obamas election as the first black president of the harvard law review led to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations the university of chicago law school provided him with a fellowship and an office to work on his book the book took him a lot longer than expected and at the end it devolved into guess what his own autobiography instead of writing a scholarly paper focusing on race relations for which he had been paid obama could not resist writing about his most sublime self he entitled the book dreams from my father  not surprisingly adolph hitler also wrote his own autobiography when he was still nobody so did stalin for a narcissist no subject is as important as his own self why would he waste his precious time and genius writing about insignificant things when he can write about such an august being as himself narcissists are often callous and even ruthless as the norm they lack conscience this is evident from obamas lack of interest in his own brother who lives on only one dollar per month a man who lives in luxury who takes a private jet to vacation in hawaii and who has raised nearly half a billion dollars for his campaign something unprecedented in history has no interest in the plight of his own brother why because his brother cannot be used for his ascent to power a narcissist cares for no one but himself this election is like no other in the history of america  the issues are insignificant compared to what is at stake what can be more dangerous than having a man bereft of conscience a serial liar and one who cannot distinguish his fantasies from reality as the leader of the free world i hate to sound alarmist but one must be a fool if one is not alarmed many politicians are narcissists they pose no threat to others they are simply self serving and selfish obama evinces symptoms of pathological narcissism which is different from the runofthemill narcissism of a richard nixon or a bill clinton for example to him reality and fantasy are intertwined this is a mental health issue not just a character flaw pathological narcissists are dangerous because they look normal and even intelligent it is this disguise that makes them treacherous today the democrats have placed all their hopes in obama but this man could put an end to their party the great majority of blacks have also decided to vote for obama only a fool does not know that their support for him is racially driven let us call a spade a spade this is racism pure and simple the truth is that while everyone carries a misconceived collective guilt towards the blacks for wrongs done centuries ago by a bygone people to a bygone people the blacks carry a collective rancor enmity or vendetta towards nonblacks and to this day want to stand up to the white man they seem to be stuck in 19th century the downside of this is that if obama turns out to be the disaster i predict he will cause widespread resentment among the whites the blacks are unlikely to give up their support of their man cultic mentality is pernicious and unrelenting they will dig their heads deeper in the sand and blame obamas detractors of racism this will cause a backlash among the whites the white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support i predict that in less than four years racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960s obama will set the clock back decades america is the bastion of freedom the peace of the world depends on the strength of america  and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations it is no wonder that ahmadinejad hugo chavez the castrists the hezbollah the hamas the lawyers of the guantanamo terrorists and virtually all sworn enemies of america are so thrilled by the prospect of their man in the white house america is on the verge of destruction there is no insanity greater than electing a pathological narcissist as president,politics

dude i am not even american nor would i consider myself very liberal i just realise that whatever views obama may have he symbolises change hes black for one thing which is big and i bet you that his presidency will awaken a very ugly monster in the heart of america one that is steeped in racist bigotry he is more than just a good politican or a charasmatic man his race makes him a symbol an icon if you will you should be considering the far reaching implications of his election and dont limit that to his policies,politics
i support obama because of the fact that hes managed to take whats started to seem like a farfetched fairy story hope for something better than this and actually made it sound realistic again i support him because he is decent and thoughtful and kind i support him because he refused to let fearmongering become a permanent part of who we are as a country and what we expect from leadership i support him because hes actually gotten people to get together and believe that they can fix this shitpile weve snuggled ourselves into i support him because he says we can instead of i can when discussing his plans for the nation i support him because the entire world is hoping and waiting for him to be elected  it takes an extraordinary person to elicit that kind of global response and i support him because i think that the friends weve lost around the world might be regained again with him as our representative i support him because he believes in diplomacy instead of were america and we say so type politics i support him because he visibly loves and respects his wife and its the first time i saw anyone in the white house with that sort of functional and healthy relationship i support him because hes got a unique view of this country coming from white and black parents american and foreignborn parents and he can respect and understand those points of view i also like his policies i dont agree with all of them nor do i think hes the second coming and if he manages to do all he said he wants to do quite frankly ill be surprised but i expect him to strive to do it and i think he has good intentions and i believe in his sincerity i myself had come to the conclusion that we as a nation have gone beyond redemption and i actually found myself thinking well maybe not there are enough of us who have had enough of this shit and were going to rally behind a person whose voice hopes and ideas resonate with our own and were going to change it hes a good man and i want a good man as the president sorry for the rant,politics

i had someone come to our door on saturday he seemed a little surprised probably because were one of the two white families in the neighborhood he asked if i was voting and who i was voting for yes and obama respectively at that point he told me to take care of any parking tickets make sure i dont have any outstanding warrants etc this was presented as some sort of civil service to me rather than a threat i told him thats crap and there arent going to be police staking out the polling station and he knows it he kind of shrugged his shoulders and thanked me for my time i spent the couple hours following him down the street i wasnt on his heels or arguing with him but every house he stopped at i was next in line i knocked on the door and explained i was one of their neighbors hey youre that white boy who lives by the school and the man they just talked to was a liar who was trying to scare them into not voting the third house was an old black lady who was almost in tears because she finally had the chance to vote for a _qualified_ black man but didnt think she could make the walk to the civic center and back i asked about absentee she laughed and said she didnt want to throw her vote away i told her i could drive her up when im voting she was happy and started talking about how she couldnt bring herself to ever support a fool like jesse jackson or someone chisholm but she would be proud to vote for obama i found about a dozen other people who could use rides tomorrow too so me and the wife will be shuttling the guy i was following hit about 3540 houses before he finally left i think if anything he rallied the opposition rather than scaring it,politics

to me 1 a president is a countrys head cheerleader and ultimate representative to the world at large 2 a president instills hope to the country 3 a president holds people accountable including himself 4 a president is thoughtful regarding his actions and mindful of others 5 a president is consistent but not inflexible or unchangeable 6 a president is a reachable and attainable role model 7 a president is able to communicate at a 7th grade level without making anyone feel talked down to 8 a president is a real person and not a 2 dimensional black and white parody of a person 9 a president knows how to say i dont know and then surrounds himself with people smarter than he is 10 a president stands up for the citizens of the country even when he doesnt agree with them or they dont agree with him these are all qualities that ive seen in obama and why i have chosen to vote for him 1 obama is the hands down choice of anyone living outside of this country the world is as excited to see obama for president as many of us are 2 10s and 100s of thousands of people show up to his rallys to hear inspiring messages while hundreds or thousands show up to hear mccains spew of hate 3 throughout his career and throughout his campaign obama has been willing to step forward and say im sorry whether it be admitting to his past use of drugs and current smoking problems apologizing for ruining a reporters hopes for a hookup or apologizing on behalf of his campaign volunteers for excluding muslim women from a photo op big or small he has stepped up and taken responsibility 4 obama is careful about what he does without being overcautious when it was obvious to most people that his campaign should come out swinging against negative ads obama kept things simple and didnt hit back hitting back hard would have been seen negatively to people he was trying to reach he understands the need for talking to people as well as listening to them 5 obama has been a poster boy for consistency during this election seen by some as unflappable given the vile rumors and hate mongering against him he has provided high level plans for things hed like to change with his administration but also been clear that its important to get in understand the current problems and then try to implement policy towards those ends with the full picture 6 obama is a person any of our children could become he didnt marry rich he didnt win the lotto or inherit his dads company his lifestyle isnt opulent or whorish hes a self made man from a broken home who worked hard and proved we can all attain the american dream while hes richer than joesixpack its not a wealth thats outside of achievement 7 no giant words no monumental philosophical ideals just plain simple talk that plain simple talk makes everyone feel that they are the one being talked to or talked about 8 mccainpalin would have you believe that there are good people and that there are bad people they would have you believe that only bad people talk to bad people and good people talk to good people the truth is that people have flaws and they do stupid things and being able to look past a persons flaws is a great attribute for any leader painting that person into a caricature or stereotype labeling them criminal or terrorist socialist or messiah is not such a great attribute for a leader 9 obama leans on smart people hes tapped former heads of state military leaders and the best and brightest to create workable goals for the future of our country his inexperience is tempered by his ability to attract smart and passionate advisors some of the people advising him are even those who used to be considered the enemy john mccain would have you believe that john mccain can handle it all with his years of experience and palins awesome background they can take on the commiesruskiesgooks etc 10 obama promotes civility when hecklers spoke up during a rally he was forceful but polite he kept the crowd from booing and ensured that the hecklers would get there time hes consistently sent the message that negativism booing and name calling at the rallies arent called for his physical demeanor while engaging in a debate shows that hes paying full attention to the opposition while theyre speaking his hips are directed towards them his eyes focused on them and a friendly smile always at the ready no eyerolling cursing or looks of disgust just simple mindful respect for another persons point of view,politics
go back to school till you know what the fuck you are actually talking about a couple points no i repeat no constitutional scholar will ever suggest that james madisons thoughts on how the constitution ought to be interpreted are somehow to be given more weight then those of the other men who ratified and amended it to suggest otherwise is complete bullshit and once you accept that fact and you have no choice if you respect historical reality you must also accept the fact that the us constitution was not adopted as a rigid document whose meaning could only be interpreted one way and in fact to the contrary was only adopted because it provided enough leeway in terms of interpretation such that all of the many disparate interests therein represented felt that their constituencies would not be compromised through its adoption and ratification all of which is just to say that far from being a precise document that rigidly lays out distinct rules the us constitution is a deliberately vague document that deliberately left open the possibility of alternative interpretations thats its genius and thats the only reason it got ratified by the remarkably disparate former colonies get educated man its worth it strict constructionism appealing as it is at a certain level of intellectual sophistication has never really held water and if you need evidence to that effect you need only look at the course of history every major legal decision in this country that is now taken for granted was at some point opposed on the grounds of strict constructionism i give you slavery womens suffrage jim crow laws to name but a few obvious instances,politics

im not voting for obama because of his socialist ideology because i believe in the constitution of the united states and i want to keep my country free of big government intervention i believe in the 2nd amendment that i have just as much right to possess a way to defend myself as any other human being obama does not the second amendment is your homeland security people that was its intended purpose from the very beginning criminals wont care if guns are illegal they will have them anyways and if you did somehow manage to get all the guns criminals would then resort to bombs would you rather have a criminal on a bus with a handgun or wearing an suicide vest the vests are easier to make i dont believe in abortion i believe in personal responsibility and selfcontrol i know that if i have sex with someone that its possible they could become pregnant even with precautions obama would have a society that leans on abortion as a form of birth control instead of having selfrestraint and thinking of the greater good well just kill inconvenient babies and go on living a selfish carefree lifestyle spreading disease and thinking of others as simply objects to be used and desired instead of people that need to be loved and treated with respect the people of the state of california voted 614 to 38 that marriage was a union between one man and one woman thats democracy but the liberal judges struck down the peoples decision making in null and void in favor of their own views thats not what america is about i also believe in the sanctity of marriage marriage between a man and a woman these limits god put in place to protect us from disease from the emotional trauma of broken relationships broken families and the lustful hurtful and inconsiderate actions of those that dont understand that these limits were placed there out of love gay marriage in the end is not about the law at all but more about forcing their views on others what does the government need to recognize marriage for in the first place getting the government out of the marriage business entirely is a much cheaper better solution its a religious institution after all no homosexual marriage is about calling what is evil good its about trying to legitimize their own actions they are actively trying to create a society where their sinful and destructive behavior is not only tolerated but accepted if you think im wrong then explain the overwhelming prevalence of homosexuality on television how come such a small minority of people are represented in such inflated numbers homosexuals can say whatever they want they cannot change the simple fact that marriage is a covenant between 2 people and god without god there is no covenant and god doesnt allow homosexual marriage,politics

what if you talk social issues at least in christian churches congregations look to their pastors to provide interpretation of scripture that is relevant to their daily lives for example in california right now we have prop 8 on the ballot which if passed would legally define marriage as between a man and a woman can a pastor talk about homosexuality now or does he have to wait till november 5th would you restrict talking politics to endorsing specific ballot measures or candidates if not what would you seek to limit and how on earth would this be administered government auditors in the pews,politics

this was a comment i received on my blog tonight this fellows sincerity moved me and i thought id share it here ive copied the full text below text from the headline link my best friends gay to all the straight dudes like me out there its the day before the election by the end of tomorrow my best friend will know whether or not he can be legally married in the state of california and as the polls stand right now it looks like he wont be able to do that and that bums me out brother if you told me when i was growing up that my best friend would be gay id have laughed in your face maybe even punched you in it i grew up in a rural area of maryland filled with mullets acid wash jeans and the good ole boys that wore them both hell i was one of em part of me still is i went to catholic school a private university and didnt know an openly gay person until i moved to los angeles i played smear the queer called my friends faggots and if someone did something silly or stupid id call him gay i simply had no frame of reference perhaps if you are reading this you dont either and i can appeal to you in these final hours i know every single one of you whether you are man enough to admit it or not hopes to find your perfect partner dare i say soulmate personally i have visions of finding love at first sight going through the first stages of love where i cant get enough of this beautiful woman falling madly in love with her marrying and living happily ever after where we both die peacefully in our sleep holding hands guess what we arent the only ones that have those feelings gay men and women have the exact same dreams that we do because that is what people do dream we dream of what we want to be when we grow up the kind of house we want to live in where we are going to vacation and what our perfect relationship looks like and just like all of us straight guys where we prefer blondes over brunettes over redheads there are some people that prefer others of the same sex thats really all there is to it believe it or not they arent doing it to spite you i know that some of you who oppose same sex marriage want to make this into a huge deal where the door will be open for people to marry rabbits and aliens and anything else you can imagine but the simple fact of the matter is that argument doesnt work my gay best friend doesnt want to marry a rabbit any more than i do or an alien for that matter although i would have sex with that hot alien chick on the new battlestar gallactica i am in the entertainment industry and since moving to la i have met hundreds of gay guys and i have to tell you all a secret shhhh they are people exactly like you and me except they happen to like other dudes i know that seems weird to you it did to me too when i first moved out here but since then i have observed them and taken notes and this is what i have found observation of the gays 1 they have feelings just like you and me they experience love hate jealousy disappointment and elation 2 some of them actually have more successful relationships than we do imagine that two people in a relationship that actually works what would you give for that ive looked up to the sky and offered god anything for a successful relationship im still waiting and i envy anyone that can make that work 3 gays are people they are entitled to the same things all other people are the right to vote the right to free speech and should be afforded the right to marry one another its simply a matter of equality 4 gays are generally clean this has nothing to do with anything but i wanted to share all of the data with you my best friend is an amazing singer and one late night we were hanging out with a few friends and he sang loch lomond look it up when he was finished without even thinking about it i said one day i want you to sing that at my wedding he was honored and then i started thinking about what honor i could bestow upon him to reciprocate and it hit me that i may never be able to do something like that for him if prop 8 passes tomorrow ive seen him these last two weeks in the throws of a budding relationship and it has been a real education for me im not used to being this tight with a buddy who also happens to be gay and i have to say there are still things that open my eyes hes in that beautiful romantic phase of a new relationship where they want to spend every moment together ive never seen him so happy so inspired and that makes me happy although it is still hard for me to understand how he can be physically attracted to another guy were loud sweaty and not that smart what i do understand and appreciate are the feelings and it is absolutely amazing to witness i hope he falls madly in love with this guy they move in together and if they so choose are allowed to marry one another in the eyes of the law and all of their fabulous party guests if that happens im sure ill cry im a sucker for weddings and in the meantime im going to remain positive and think about what i can do for him at his wedding its only fair as it looks between the two of them now i better start taking guitar lessons tonight so from one bro to another id like to ask this favor please vote no on prop 8 even if you dont want to do it for the gay guys because you dont know them do it for me a straight dude because i really cant stand having to owe anyone anything thank you for reading this no on 8 by stirling gardner,politics

j edgar hoover was born in washington on january 1 1895 and rose to become one of the most powerful men in america some say even more powerful then the presidents he served under it is more or less common knowledge that he was a transvestite and had a life long relationship with fellow fbi man clyde tolson there are numerous stories of hoover appearing in drag in new york usually in a red dress he liked to be called mary such is the interest in hoover that vanity fair commissioned hidden hoover and robert risko to create an artists impression of hoover for an article that basically described the private life of j edgar hoover dressed mary hoover by robert risko he apparently never had any romantic attachments with women he lived with his mother until she died he dressed like a dandy even in high school as far as anyone could remember he never had a date hoover was a master of the dirty tricks campaign and kept a lot of dirt on other people in his files some say that hoover was responsible for the intelligence failure at pearl harbor biographers have found no convincing evidence to prove the widely held belief that hoover was a homosexual however the mob thought different and were rumoured to have had pictures of him in a dress this is why hoover would never touch the mob the biographer summers presents an abundance of evidence to show that he was a transvestite nevertheless not all agree former fbi agents have pointed out that hoover was himself under secret surveillance for his own protection and such behavior would have been reported one of hoovers most trusted former lieutenants carla deke deloach says it is very troubling to me that people will promote these things for selfish reasons they distort the truth and im afraid young people might believe this junk hoover is depicted as perhaps the most powerful politician in washington feared by every president who served over him the only players who were immune to hoovers secret files were those who had secrets of their own about his personal life  namely the mafia mafia bosses obtained information about hoovers sex life and used it for decades to keep the fbi at bay without this the mafia as we know it might never have gained its hold in america hoovers alleged homosexuality was known to the mafia who apparently had photographs and hoovers frequent gambling junkets were paid by his mafia friends,politics

so this guy mr miller feels entitled to judge obama for spreading the wealth when he essentially took the wealth of people he knew in order to start his drilling business look not everyone wants to be a small business owner when you borrow money you borrow money it doesnt matter who you borrow it from he borrowed from his family and friends who borrowed their capital from where lets see most likely from banks 2nd mortgages home equities etc who incidentally now are borrowing from the government get off your high horse mr miller just because you never went to college and barely made it out of high school were supposed to feel sorry for you youre saying only real americans dont aspire to the best education this earth has to offer youre saying there werent more efficient ways of starting a business or having a business plan what really pisses me off is that obama came from probably the most underprivileged scapegoated ethnic group this country has to offer mixed blackwhite american he is inherently accepted by neither race culturally and began at the bottom economically mr miller you sit there and paint a picture of a man you dont know who you believe got handouts and started off entitled from who from his poor grandmother and grandfather he earned everything he had growing up from scholarships to private and government loans to go to school most importantly he paid those loans back was obama entitled like mccain whom i presume youre voting for obama didnt get a hand me down from any living relative he wasnt basically given jobs his entire life because he was borne from two navy admirals needless to say mccain squandered all he ever got from those legacies early in life and during his collegiate years i like that mr miller points out that never has he relied on government to provide anything for him if you are so against the government helping people out why the hell did you get a high school degreeor did you go to some east texas oilfield subsidized private school to get that diploma you and your parents lived off of the government until you had the willingness to start your business there are countless things government provides that you would be shit and helpless without please do not discredit it of course it cannot grow unchecked but give credit where its due,politics
exactly if they really believe that abortion is murder then they would be in favor of jailing or even executing abortionists and women who get abortions very few outside of the ultramilitant fringe advocate this proving that they dont really think its murder with abortion and birth control just sticking it in there isnt enough for a man to pass on his genes he has to be a good companion husband and good father material to convince a woman to bear his child this makes men and women equal in their power to decide which genes make it into the next generation not only does this change the power dynamic it also might change which genes are favored by evolution in the past irresponsible and sociopathic males had more of an advantage female control of reproduction could help remove the rapist personality type from the human population the struggle against reproductive rights is about maintaining the geneticevolutionary status quo i dont think very many of the people involved actually understand this consciously but thats what its about,politics

this drives home what i think is the crucial point that antigay folks need to understand gay men love each other its particularly important to me that this be understood because my own two most meaningful relationships have been with a man and with a woman respectively ive experienced love both ways and its the same kind of love antigay activists prefer to imagine homosexuality as a sexual dysfunction wherein sex with the opposite gender is the subject of an unnatural lust theyll say that marriage doesnt apply because gay families arent reproductive families but its hard to miss the subtext that gay men and women dont love each other like straight families do well george takei and brad altman havent been together for 18 years because of a weird sexual dysfunction theyve been together for 18 years because they love each other the status quo level of discrimination in the united states wont change until the population at large understands that gay men and women love each other not merely lusting for each other not just fucking each other loving,politics

yes there have been rumors about lincoln and there has almost certainly been at least one president with homosexual attractions in your couple hundred years of history i choose to use the word gay as opposed to homosexual however as it implies a specifically contemporary sensibility which truly has not existed except for very recently eg an openly homosexual man carrying on public homosexual relationships,politics
when you go out to dinner do you split the check based on how much money you and your friends make people seem to forget robin hood is a tale about a guy who lived in a time when the wealthy obtained and protected their wealth through force we live in a society where excepting interferences by the government all wealth is earned and lost through voluntary trade between free people in the marketplace that means a modernday robin hood is totally immoral not a hero now of course you can argue that the government has helped the wealthy earn their wealth to an extent but that means we should fix the system and move on just as we have to let oj simpson walk free because upholding the principles of our justice system is more important than whether one guilty man is allowed to escape punishment the same is true of our current system the worst thing you could do is have the government point a gun at anybody and demand they hand over their money to other people which is implicitly what is happening when we redistribute peoples income through taxes thats why i think its a really ugly development right now that the poormiddle class whether they admit to it or not part of their motivation and why obamas tax cuts for 95 plan rings true so well is because people feel like the rich have been taking from the poor via government and through simply owning powerful corporations that shaft consumers and employees and so now they want to turn the tables and take back their money this is eyeforaneye,worldnews

before i address your points you need to be clear what your argument is as you appear to have flipflopped first you claim that the us is doing the nations of the world a favour by occupying them and that they should man up and increase the size of their own military forces now you appear claim that youre ok with the occupation of these nations for protection of us interests  which is an admission that you think the forces there are used for power projection rather than for protection of the local government and populace so which do you believe that the us is a selfless protector of ungrateful socialist nations or that the us is a special nation entitled to occupy others to protect its own financial interests in which case it could never be in us interests for that nation to be anything other than weak to hold both views is rather inconsistent,politics

on this historic election day i went to my local school to vote this morning at 620 am walked around to the front of the school and saw a long line as i went around the back of the school the line stretched all the away around to the very back end of the school by the swings and the playground there must have been at least 400500 people in line waiting to vote at such an early time in the morning i had never seen such a long line to vote in an election presidential or otherwise it was a little funny to see people come around the corner at the back of the school only to sigh and exclaim wow as they saw the amount of people that came out for this election as i got to the front of the line there was a shortage of people with last names starting sz so they let people cut in line at the front in order to speed up the line which i thought was smart an hour after waiting observing overhearing people talking and chatting with a few women in front of me it seemed like everyone was voting for obama i got to the front showed my drivers license and proceeded to cast my vote finally after 2 years of this grueling campaign i was actually voting i had a choice to do a paper form or electronic ballot and of course being an avid reddit reader and being kept up to date about all the electronic voting hacks and irregularities i chose paper i filled out my vote 4 circles in total and gave it to the woman to be electronically scanned hoping the scanner wasnt hacked either i was 344 to vote this morning at this school location i got my i voted oval flag sticker and proudly displayed it on my chest and walked out after all that has been said and done these past couple of years my voice has been heard this was the one thing i could control in our us democracy off i went to work only arriving an hour late and feeling a huge sense of relief and pride lets hope that this time the result is an irrefutable landslide,politics
of course we are against a combined european force we are against any military that may be able to match ours i thought that would be understood it is one thing for individual countries to man up and spend more on their defense but to allow the eu to hold an army would be against us interests the us forces in europe kept the soviet union at bay for years before atomic weapons were in mass production remember the start of this was 60 years ago correct i meant russia come on you think that just because they are the same subset religion that would keep them from invading saudi arabia gtyou seemed perfectly ok with it when the soviets were on the receiving end and now you whine when the same tactics are used on you welcome to reality  insurgents never fight fair  if they did theyd never win you should know this from your own history i assume you are speaking of the soviets fight in afghanistan of course we were happy with that we were supplying the weapons and funding not whining just stating a fact it is a bitch to fight against those that dont play fair it is especially hard when in spite of what you read on reddit your side is not interested in prolonged occupation it is easier to completely destroy a country and then hold it by force than it is to remove a government and rebuild that country gthardly you claimed that your bases were there to secure us which is an incredibly vague statement i assumed you meant for defense of the nation rather than for projection of power for your own financial gain secure us means we will do everything in our power to protect us interests anything that can cause insecurity in the us falls under that umbrella if europe is invaded or builds an army that would make the us insecure if the middle east degenerates to a regional fight oil could be cut off that would make the us insecure if south america is threatened that could cut off imported food that would make the us insecure the us is top dog and the rest of the world should be happy with that we dont invade countries to keep them if that was the case we would own half the world we invade countries to protect us sorry if that does not fit the political leanings of reddit but that is the real world so to sum it all up the us selfishly guards itself just to bring this back on topic if obama wins it will weaken the us on the global stage but make no mistake about it he too will protect us interests note to any groups that wants to make bidens prediction of an obama test to come true dont just dont obama is weaker than mccain on security but by no means will he be a pussy,politics

but my god has asked me to not partake in sodomy and homosexual activities as a sign of faith he has asked me to me to refrain as a show of love for him my god also teaches tolerance and love for all man even the sinners my god also blessed everyone with free agency and free will so that when i do choose to follow the things hes asked of me its strictly for him and not due merely to social pressure god will only judge people based on their faith and love in him god did not give us free will so that we could take it away from others i dont believe that by illegalizing gay marriage you will stop the sin and even if it did does the mere fact that they stopped because of politicalsocial variables bring them closer to god no like most faithbuilding exercises its your choice in following the word of god that brings you closer and truly shows the respect and love for him one should have but since homosexuals have not agreed upon my set of beliefs i will continue spreading my word but i will not force my beliefs on others when they are unconstitutional or inherently encourage prejudice and hatredunequality to a group whose quoteunquote sin doesnt affect any innocent victims its not like murder or stealing in that it negatively affects someone where as gay sexmarriage is 2 consenting adults that dont believe in your god wanting to live peacefully united together,politics

you have to keep in mind he used to be respected he fought corruption he used to vote against bush when he started his campaign journalists could ask him any question and hed answer with no bullshit but then something changed perhaps it was his from his party or it was his initiative but he had to conform to what his party wanted him to do i remember reading an article in which a journalist talked about how mccain seemed so pissed off that he couldnt answer his questions truthfully i think mccain wasnt really in control of this campaign i think that when he defended obama in front of a crowd and got booed for it by saying that obabama was a good man he showed his true colors to the other people in his party who would rather have him cater to the racists and bigots demonizing the opposition is never a good idea i know that ive been guilty of this but i dont think john mccain was inherently evil i just think he wasnt in control,politics

over the past few months ive heard more and more people say how obama has been able to connect with young people like myself many have made mention of how much his words have resonated within our generation some people have tried to paint us as wagon jumpers under exposed to the real issues and simply doing whats cool while there are some people who may support obama because its the popular thing to do i know most people had very good reason to support this man and i am deeply offended by the outoftouch pundits from both sides of the aisle who tried to demean people of my age i apologize if ive lived the last 8 years of my life in disgust with my country for far too many reasons you know the 8 years in which i graduated high school college and started life in the real world or what many of you old timers tell us youth were the best years of life you remember those years right you started making decisions for yourself the 8 years where you developed your own goals aspirations and most importantly became your own person independent of the adults who used to make decisions for you so for someone to tell me that its wrong to be inspired by a mans words to understand his dreams and aspirations for this country or to share his hopes for a better tomorrow i cant help but become upset im sorry if you dont see that we need to make a change in our environmental policy before its too late im sorry if you dont agree that the wealthiest of the wealthy in america have plenty of money while the rest of us struggle i feel terrible that a lot of you cant see how corrupt this government is and how capitalistic greed as it stands in america today is not so far away from ruining this country simply to make more money i feel deeply sorry for those of you who have forgotten that america above all else stands for freedom freedom to practice any religion or none at all freedom from illegal searches freedom to protest freedom to be able to speak out against an unjust war without fearing retribution freedom to achieve any goal you may have i am sorry for those of you who dont see iraq as the glass koolaid that it is im sorry that you dont have the opportunity to travel to foreign countries and see how negative the worlds view of the united states has become during bushs reign but i do and so do millions of other americans young and old alike maybe thats why we made sure our voices were heard maybe its because we havent lived for 30 years under a slowing collapsing way of government and havent had the chance to become apathetic to it maybe its because we have lived through the prime of our lives in a country that we just couldnt be proud of no matter how much we wanted to be or maybe just maybe its because we have a larger stake in this election than the rest of you after all tomorrow is where i grow from a young adult into a parent a career professional and watch many of you from the older generation move on to the next life tomorrow is when i have kids to raise bills to pay and an entire life to lead tomorrow is when we as americans have the chance to put this country back where it should be in the world as the america the rest of the world looks up to and admires maybe thats why as a generation we were captivated by a man who spoke to us not because kim that sexy brunette on the 8th floor said she supported him not because puff daddy told us he would kill us if we didnt vote we figured out after 2004 he was lying about that no it was because after spending the 8 best years of our lives growing up under arguably the worst president in american history we couldnt sit back and let you old people decide what our futures were going to be long after you have died no as the people with the most at stake in this election we stood up and did what many of you seemed too lazy and unwilling to do we made a change,politics

why do you see equal rights as a state vs federal issue not criticizing merely curious we have plenty of other equality legislationconstitutional amendments at the federal level why not this one if you dont like getting the marriage angle involved as many seem to here why not just make the amendment something more generic like no laws based on sex not sexual orientation but sex no laws which reference man vs woman male vs female i think orientation already has many equal right protections but the define marriage as a man and a woman crap sort of skirts that issue if there is no legal wiggle room for legislation based on sex then out these rules go,politics

when i went to bed last night i was an american i woke this morning a man with no country no leader no direction and no purpose i did not leave my country my country abandoned me jesus asked his father to forgive them for they know not what they do i am not jesus and will not forgive the murder of a country that i once fought for and was willing to die for that country no longer exists a breed of americans note lower case have beaten it down and traded it for trinkets worth less than the beads that bought manhattan island so long ago do you liberals really believe you are going to get all these things the boober promised you do you think this muslimmarxist mutant mole cares about you and wants to shower you with benefits and free money who are you where did the americans go i dont know the people who put this phlegmwad in office who the hell are you and what did you do with my country i do not know you but i will i know where to look for you what makes you think you deserve this country you didnt bleed for her you didnt invest in her spiritually you mocked her and chastised her even as she sheltered you and kept you safe and warm because you did not have the courage and backbone to stand up and fight to save her you have no claim to her future such as it is such as it shall become i fear i find it ironic that the government which used to pay me combat and flight pay gave me a weapon and told me to shoot communists has now become that which i used to destroy this is a journey no man no warrior should ever have to take yet here we are day one of a brazen new world couched in racism and empty rhetoric and worshipped by men and women who are not worth the powder and shot it would take to blow them all to glory what a long strange trip it has been too why there are many reasons no one reason is a complete telling of this tale we could analyze the election the candidates the tactics and so on and in the end solve nothingwhy is a luxury we cannot afford yet must pony up to pay for when the bill comes due the main reason why in a word apathy we allowed this scum to build up in the filters until it choked the engine to silent sputters then we ignored it until it died why is unimportant now all we are left with is the what do we do now a brother in ink newsletter writer told me last year but bean it is all our own damn fault yes jaksavin it is our fault we didnt care enough to safeguard her we didnt believe she was vulnerable and didntscratch thatwouldnt see the danger welldo you see it now you will very soon if not tonight next week or next month how does it feel to watch our own complacency eat our nations guts from the inside out was your apathy worth the trade you made tonight i mourn for my brothers on the wall in washington tonight they died again there are millions of dead men walking around tonight that dont even know theyre dead yet are you one of them i share the blame i could have fought harder i could have sounded the alarm i could have thrown rocks at the son of a bitch if nothing else but i too was asleep i believed in and cast my faith to the american people a people who have proven unworthy of keeping the grand republic we inherited through the blood sweat and trials of our fathers and their fathers fathers fathers fathersas far back as there was a nation called america you gave it away i gave it away nowwhat are you and i going to do about it they taught me in jungle evasion and survival training school that the best time to plan an escape is early in your captivity so you still have the strength and will to carry it out time plays for the captors and works against the prisoners are you going to roll over and play possum wait till the sun shines nellyby and by generix the most vulnerable of the legs which this beast stand on is the media oh yeah ive been hammering these useless pieces of dog crap since 2003 but im not done with these weasels yet unless you are blind or have been living in a cave for five years you have seen the press and talking heads thoroughly tattooed to oboobers hip in lock step and pushing him every yard of the way this person would not even be recognized let alone elected without the strong voice of the media behind him so heres something we can do it will take a concentrated effort and may require some small sacrifice but at this time its the only weapon we have first you must commit to buying and using only generic products write a letter to each network and news show tell them i will not buy any product advertised on or sponsoring your show nonezero then write the sponsors and tell them the same thing make sure they understand the connection between the advertising dollars their grossly slanted journalism and your power as a consumer to not buy their products thereby cutting off the advertising dollars and the operating funds that pay their salaries this applies to automobiles tooif you were going to buy a new ford buy instead a year old ford from a private owner or used car lot put no money in the pockets of companies that sponsor this fifth column reporting the effect will not be immediate but hang in for the long haul and punish the sponsors and dollars that put this unamerican slug in office and it will have an effect it is vital that you maintain correspondence with the networks and the sponsors so count on spending some money in postagee mails dont work dont waste the electrons even sending e mails this must start as an organized grassroots movement with the purpose of disabling the liberals bully pulpit and putting the newsies on defensive for a change well work on the rest once we get this piece started and we have to start somewhere and soon are you a warrior or a possum an american or a citizen of the greater world your call i know what im going to do generix beansimple said it what are you going to do now fight or flee and above all think for yourself and pray for our nation,politics

i was actually disappointed in that speech primarily due to his lack of calling people out for booing obama he should have given them one last ride on the straight talk express and told them to get over their hateful bigotry and support the man who has been elected their leader if obama screws up like bush did then fine we can all hate him but for now i think he needs us all behind him mccain supporters included mccain failed to put them in their place and rather just wanted them to keep quiet so he could finish the speech someone else wrote for him,politics
i really which the cons would stop using the term messiah in a derogatory tone and associating that word with obama hes a man the next president of the united states of america and like any man and any president before him and any president after worthy of respect lets also remember that by disrespecting him you disrespect the millions of americans who voted if you dont respect that effort then maybe you should pick a country to live in that doesnt allow its people to vote,politics

2010 ballot initiative the traditional marriage amendment this amendment will define in the constitution of this state marriage as a partnership exclusively between one man and one woman who are white christian and landowners the idea is a simple one and hopefully will do the greatest damage to the only thing the antigay marriage crowd has going for them this bizarre idea that traditional inherently means good that the old ways are inherently the best except for yknow medicine science technology political myopia etc people are stupid and believe traditional means comfortable to such a ridiculous degree they support such nonsense out of whatever feeling it is that gets even the best of us to worship nostalgic nonsense of the past opine for the halcyon days of youth and such crap irrespective of every advance made since take that word that concept of oldgood away from the antigay crowd and they have nothing with which to convince the average person any longer i hope of course that such an initiative would go down in screaming flames but would need a great deal of public attention to do so if its on the ballot in one state even a historically liberal one and gets no press it might actually stand reasonable odds of passing which we do not naturally want to happen not that i think such a decision wont immediately be challenged and struck down but theres no good reason it should come to that in the first place and that is of course the shit of the situation that i hate to admit i have no idea if the bill would fail as planned or not not because i think the racists are a majority but because people dont generally care enough about what they vote for hopefully this will change that and hopefully and with possibly no better odds i will now shit liquid gold that can cure cancer gay marriage is fundamentally a civil rights issue and needs to be treated as such pundits refuse to do so politicians refuse to do so and since the rights of homosexuals to marry and adopt are being chipped away bit by bit every election my thinking is that the only way to stem the tide is to put forth the most audacious embarassing and why yes quite racist indeed ballot initiative possible i will be doing so in my state of maryland for the year 2010 and need to know how to actually get such an amendment on the ballot and would ask that everyone interested do the same on another note it occurs to me that the semiracist nature of my proposal might strike harder for well okay look for some reason black people seem as a demographic to not like gay people particularly prop 8 for instance was nearly tied across all racial demographics with the exception of blacks who supported it 70 to 30 in 04 i remember in particular black churches speaking out about gay marriage and racebaiting flyers taking advantage of as much i remember i think it was martin luther kings daughter saying something to the effect of my daddy didnt die for no queers or somesuch well thought out argument i keep not understanding it and it keeps happening i keep hoping its a blip and not a trend and keep hating my optimism why is this of all things the case why do they who really only acheived civil equality some 2 generations ago support robbing another group of it so vehemently i dont pretend to know the answer but certainly a prop with such racial overtones would at the very least bring those questions out and force an answer,politics
just tell that to the countless individuals at martin luther king rallies in the 60s who couldnt so much as sit on a bus next to a white person because they were  as you put it brown we are not racists to acknowledge the fact that a man who in another time could not have voted sat on a bus or used the same drinking fountain as a white person is now our elected leader,politics

why do you think sodomites people do not have the same rights as anyone else  all 8 passing means is that marriage is stll defined as marriage between a man and a woman it does not take away anyones rights it prevents the crazys from changeing something that is held dear to the majority of the nation and the world in one word marriage  gay used to mean happy joyful etc but now means a man who fucks another up the butt what are we going to change next the word man because woman feel disenfranchised  think this through surely there is a way to have a relationship between a man and a man or a woman and a woman defined in law  i dont know call it a sodomy licence or somethig like that  whatever you want  just leave marriage alone,politics
well generally if were going this far were drastically changing the definition of civil union to the point where inbreeding isnt a concern at all  because why should sexual relationships get priority at this point its a contract easing a longterm sharing of living space expenses and potentially children if two spinster sisters own property together and take in their nephew to raise whats keeping them from forming a civil union if me and my business partner find a way to pay less taxes by entering into a civil union why not can we then not be compelled to testify against each other strange things happen when you try to keep the law as it is and change only a couple of variables obviously a man and a woman can already get into a marriage of convenience but id imagine drastic changes in the way we legislate marriage would make people look at it differently its a whole weird thing trying to extricate our ideas about sexual pairbonding from our general assumption that thats a heterosexual thing disclaimer it might sound like im doing an and then youll have people marrying their livestock argument but id actually be more in favour of separating concerns  one special contract for raising a child together easier access to joint property claims separate from that,politics
for me the fact that hes a black man while deeply meaningful and moving is still not the main reason im so overjoyed by this its the fact that we have a presidentelect who will take the job of governing the nation seriously he will bring a focus and intensity to this position that we havent seen in way too long what if the best way to run a nation isnt as the republicans seem to think to have the only goal be the smallest possible government what if the best way to run a nation is for its officials to do the best they can every day with intelligence industry insight and compassion for all of the people what if the best thing is to run government institutions as well as we possibly can even knowing that all human institutions are subject to corruption incompetence and failure i believe that barack obama will bring the ideal of trying his best to run the government well to the white house we must all do everything we can now to help him craft the government the best way we can  especially when we disagree on what that is yes we can,politics

ok i have a question as a straight midwestern white male i realize its easy for me to ask but here goes assuming states grant civil unions the same rights as marriage assmunches in ak notwithstanding why the fuck would anyone care if the man considers you to be married or not so the state says you cant get married who cares if you and your partner consider yourselves married and you have a ceremony with booze and bad dancing and cake and a honeymoon with lots of obligatory honeymoon sex live together raise kids if you want move to the suburbs if you want etcwhat does the state have to do with anything getting the marriage certificate from the courthouse was the least romantic part of my marriagewhich of course ended in divorce guess the man cant pick em very well,politics

a basic understanding of traditional african religion is important to understanding why this is of great importance to many kenyans i will speak of traditional african religion as the collection of general trends from the many flavors of religious practice that arose in rural africa and continue to influence many in the continent although islam and christianity have permeated africa traditional african religion is still very much ingrained into the way of life of the people for rural africans their morality and ethics are very much intertwined with daily life for urban dwellers the practice of the traditional ways is less pronounced however still in the hearts and minds of the people  many of whom maintain connections with their rural communities in a nutshell traditional african religion is based on athat which promotes life  morally sound to be celebrated and furthered bthat which diminishes life  morally bad to be rooted out and stopped so that life may continue to flourish unimpeded reproduction and lineage are both very important aspects of african religion obama is of kenyan lineage his ancestors  ancestral spirits who are the guides and guardians of the people  are kenyan when he passes he will most certainly join the ancestors of the community in guiding and guarding the people although the father was not there during his upbringing the vital force of the community runs through the blood of barack obama this is very much worthy of great celebration considering the great man he is and will continue to be,worldnews

youre wrong of course marriage is well marriage its definition as to whom it applies to has for at least roughly a millennium been defined by socioreligious contexts commonlaw be damned how do we know this simply put marriage traditionally is the establishment of a familyhousehold or inclusion into one your context of a man and a woman demonstrates this all to perfectly there is no room for polyandry or polygamy in that definition or just polyamory in general  all three of which include multiple individuals of the same gender homosexual marriage simply eliminates the opposite gender  and is contextually speaking perfectly legitimate unless of course you accept the religious conservatism that has sprung up around the concept of a man and a woman  which initially started out as an objection to white women marrying black men and as an objection to one man marrying many women neither of which i have ever understood you and your miscegenation by another name bullshit can go fuck yourselves im tired of being civil,politics

this is exactly what needs to happen marriage may well be between a man and a woman  provided that said marriage has nothing to do with the government or have any bearing on what tax exemptions or other social benefits you may receive a civil union for all partnerships between any two consenting individuals granting equal benefits under the law is the way to go then if you so please you can go to your church and have a party and they can call it a marriage and we wont bother them if they say no to gays  what happens on their private property is their own business,politics

indeed i think the internal polling told them he couldnt get a winning ticket with any orthodox running mate the remarkable thing about his campaign is that he managed even to keep it close while carrying the albatross of gop hyperignorance by any objective measure as the incumbentparty candidate he should have been facing an insuperable task from the beginning hence the hail mary as sometimes happens it went into the stands edit further this interesting set of points seems to suggest as many probably suspected that mccain was more decent and his acolytes more vicious than appeared the case when he and they were averaged together into the campaigns public voice gtmccain also was reluctant to use obamas incendiary pastor the rev jeremiah wright as a campaign issue the republican had set firm boundaries no jeremiah wright no attacking michelle obama no attacking obama for not serving in the military mccain balked at an ad using images of children that suggested that obama might not protect them from terrorism schmidt vetoed ads suggesting that obama was soft on crime no willie hortons and before word even got to mccain schmidt and salter scuttled a celebrity ad of obama dancing with talkshow host ellen degeneres the sight of a black man dancing with a lesbian was deemed too provocative,politics

gt so where had some of these adopted babies come from consider the case of ana escobar a young guatemalan woman who in march 2007 reported to police that armed men had locked her in a closet in her familys shoe store and stolen her infant after a 14month search escobar found her daughter in preadoption foster care just weeks before the girl was to be adopted by a couple from indiana dna testing showed the toddler to be escobars child in a similar case from 2006 raquel par another guatemalan woman reported being drugged while waiting for a bus in guatemala city waking to find her yearold baby missing three months later par learned her daughter had been adopted by an american couple gt on jan 1 2008 guatemala closed its doors to american adoptions so that the government could reform the broken process britain canada france germany the netherlands and spain all stopped accepting adoptions from the country several years earlier citing trafficking concerns but more than 2280 american adoptions from the country are still being processed albeit with additional safeguards stolen babies have already been found in that queue guatemalan authorities expect more gt guatemalas example is extreme it is widely considered to have the worlds most notorious record of corruption in foreign adoption but the same troubling trends have emerged on smaller scales in more than a dozen other countries including albania cambodia ethiopia liberia peru and vietnam the pattern suggests that the supply of adoptable babies rises to meet foreign demandand disappears when western cash is no longer available for instance in december 2001 the us immigration service stopped processing adoption visas from cambodia citing clear evidence that children were being acquired illicitly often against their parents wishes that year westerners adopted more than 700 cambodian children of the 400 adopted by americans more than half were less than 12 months old but in 2005 a study of cambodias orphanage population commissioned by the us agency for international development found only a total of 132 children who were less than a year oldfewer babies than westerners had been adopting every three months a few years before gt even countries with large populations such as india rarely have healthy infants and toddlers who need foreign parents indias large and growing middle class at home and in the diaspora faces fertility issues like those of their developedworld counterparts they too are looking for healthy babies to adopt some experts think that these millions of middleclass families could easily absorb all available babies the countrys pervasive poverty does leave many children fending for themselves on the street but kids are not on the street alone at the age of 2 cantwell the child protection consultant says they are 5 or 6 and they arent going to be adopted thats partly because most of these children still have family ties and therefore are not legally available for adoption and partly because they would have difficultly adjusting to a middleclass european or north american home many of these children are deeply marked by abuse crime and poverty and few prospective parents are prepared to adopt them gt surely though prospective parents can at least feel secure that their child is truly an orphan in need of a home if they receive all the appropriate legal papers unfortunately no,worldnews
then explain why each wife refers to the other as sisterwife not stepsister not sisterinlaw sisterwife also you explicitly left out polyamory arrangements which are most assuredly not onetoone unless of course you are going to imply that the legalization of one man and one woman per az prop 102 has no impact on polygamous marriage which explicitly disagrees with the reason why the mormon church ordered its followers to vote yes on that amendment a piece of information i am aware of thanks to having friends in two separate and actively mormon families whom both relayed and confirmed this statement,politics

some of mccain votes may have come from splitvotes the worst spending increases have been when one party controls the white house and the congress i for one am glad that democrats didnt get enough seats for a filibusterproof majority in congress i think this will be good for obama it forces him to find postpartisan solutions and it should increase his chances of winning again in four years now you wouldnt know this reading reddit mccain is better than the party he represents he really isnt bushcheney the sequel and obama and mccain are nearly identical in policy both trust the fed reserve both have supported the patriot act both think we should draw down in iraq and increase our efforts in afghanistan both talk about marriage as an act between a man and a woman abortion and approach to court appointments are a bit different but even obama has reached out to the prolifers the biggest difference was their demeanor mccain may have also been the greener candidate if you ignore his pandering rally cry of drill baby drill i recommend watching the frontline titled heat edit i meant filibusterproof not vetoproof,politics

fuck this post the caption it implies for the picture and anything said nasty or mean about ron paul i voted for obama but i downvote myself because i didnt have the balls to vote for a modern day patriot like ron paul he may have some crappy views on some specific issues but the man is one of the only politicians that is out their living the philosophy that he believes in and doing what he believes is right for the people and not just for his reelection the gop would be smart to embrace ron paul and the trend he represents to return the party to its core beliefs i may not agree with everything he does or supports but mocking this man is a stupid and petty thing to do to one of the few statesmen we have in this country,politics

they called mccain a war hero let me tell you about a war hero earlier this week retired marine colonel john ripley passed away at age 69 ripley is credited with saving the lives of countless fellow soldiers in vietnam gtin a videotaped interview with the us naval institute for its americans at war program ripley said he and about 600 south vietnamese were ordered to hold and die against 20000 north vietnamese soldiers with about 200 tanks gtill never forget that order hold and die ripley said the only way to stop the enormous force with their tiny force was to destroy the bridge he said gtthe idea that i would be able to even finish the job before the enemy got me was ludicrous ripley said when you know youre not going to make it a wonderful thing happens you stop being cluttered by the feeling that youre going to save your butt gtripley crawled under the bridge under heavy gunfire rigging 500 pounds of explosives that brought the twins spans down said john miller a former marine adviser in vietnam and the author of the bridge at dong ha which details the battle gtmiller said the north vietnamese advance was slowed considerably by ripley gta lot of people think south vietnam would have gone under in 72 had he not stopped them miller said gtray madonna president of the us naval academys 1962 graduating class served in vietnam as a marine at the same time and said his classmate saved countless us and south vietnamese troops gtthey would have been wrecked if the tanks had crossed madonna said he said ripley also coordinated naval gunfire that stopped the tanks from crossing at a shallower point downstream gthe was a marines marine respected highly respected by enlisted men by his peers and by his seniors madonna said gtmiller said ripley who was born in radford va descended from a long line of veterans going back to the revolutionary war he graduated from the naval academy in 1962 after enlisting in the marines out of high school and spending a year in naval school in newport ri gthe earned the quad body distinction for making it through four of the toughest military training programs in the world the army rangers marine reconnaissance army airborne and britains royal marines miller said he was also the only marine to be inducted in the us army ranger hall of fame gtripley earned the navy cross and silver star for his service in vietnam he later served on the joint chiefs of staff and was regimental commander at camp lejeune nc among other postings that man is a hero that served in vietnam not john mccain mccain was shot down and lasted exactly three days in captivity before he barfed up the fact that his daddy was an admiral and a pacific naval commander he violated the military code of conduct and for three years willingly used himself as a psyops tool for the north vietnamese he made recordings of confessions that were broadcast across enemy lines and used to demoralize american soldiers many also believe mccain gave out important information which allowed the nv to strengthen their air defenses to call john mccain a war hero is to do a tremendous disservice to real heroes such as john ripley im not belittling john mccains military service im suggesting that the media and our politicians need to think carefully what kind of standards theyre setting for heroism and how this will affect what people are willing to sacrifice to make their country and their world a better place heroes should be rare and special to me there are people like john mccain and then there are people like john ripley i call john ripley a war hero,politics

this is an argument that fundamentalists just fucking love its also retarded the state allows straight people to marry the people they are in love with it does not extend the same privilege to gay people that is not equal treatment there was a time when the state did not allow for white people to marry back people by your own specious logic it could have been argued that everyone was being treated equally that everyone was equally free to marry within their own race in loving v virginia the supreme court said this marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man fundamental to our very existence and survival to deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the fourteenth amendment is surely to deprive all the states citizens of liberty without due process of law the fourteenth amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination under our constitution the freedom to marry or not marry a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state clearly they did not believe that your logic meets the demands of the 14th amendment its hard to say how todays supreme court would judge on gay marriage but they would almost certainly have to uphold the right to gay marriage as did californias,politics

it basically comes from the fact that he wants to lower taxes on the bottom 95 bracket which in theory threatens american capitalism as we know it because the people at the top have to pay more in taxes the slippery slope tells us that well eventually comes to a point where were all taxed different amounts but that would make all our incomes equal or some bullshit basically poor people feel bad for the rich people when the tax man comes for the rich peoples taxes instead of their own some of them because they envision themselves rich someday others because theyre just plain stupid and believe all of foxs talking points to debunk it just tell them that no president has or ever will be elected with the richs approval that means that if they get to general election theyve been vetted by the corporate wealthy in this country and 100 safe to say that there will be no huge changes to tax laws or any significant moves toward socialism,politics

i have to say i am truly amazed by the number of people who claim to be students of history and yet exhibit not even the most cursury understanding of the world around them what they consistently seem to miss is the fact that our rights are godgiven or at least innate if you are inclined not to believe in god the minute that people start to believe that the government gives them their rights and freedoms is the minute that fascism takes over it doesnt matter in the least that jefferson couldnt comprehend the world we live in today his statement attribution aside was a statement about the nature of man and the construct of government if you accept that the rights of man are innate then no form of governance can _add_ to them it can only protect them or take away from them it is when people begin to rely on the state to give them all that they need that they begin to worship the state like the nationalist socialists did in germany russia and italy and i would hope that no one needs a refresher course there socialism however nice a face you try to put on it always ends the same way eventually entire generations know nothing but a life derived from the guvment which provides their welfare checks their education and free healthcare but it stimply isnt free is it and this discussion about trading freedom for security etc its nonsense again people operate under the false impression that the world works on zerosum transactions the idea that when i make a trade with someone that one of us loses and the other gains it simply isnt true people enter into agreements with other people businesses or even governments because there are gains to be had on both sides of the equation anything else would be robbery if i am willing to give up some of my prosperity through taxation in order for the government to provide for the common defense it is because it is of value to me in the end there are only two options either the people are free and the government is subserveriant to them or the other way around there is no middle ground i know people like to point to successful socialist countries and supposedly prosperous economies around the world and claim that the same thing would work in the us but prosperous socialism is a myth there has never been a country as prosperous as the us and the best measure of a countrys success is the number of people trying to get in seen alot of people illegally emmigrating to france lately nope as a matter of fact the few wealthy people from socialist countries around the world come to the us for things like healthcare etc simply because freemarket has resulted in a higher quality care than governement run or even publicprivate partnerships can produce and that my friends is the blatent evidence that larger government is bad for the people obviously governements cannot be simply abolished but the heart of the question is the role of the federal government vs the state government the form of government that we have is unique in all the world the structure was designed specifically in order to avoid the growth of government this was not an accident but an intentional effort to be sure that the states had the responsibility of governing themselves each according to their respective citizens desires libertarianism is based on nothing if not on the concept of personal freedom and selfreliance in the classical sense liberalism referred to _personal_ liberties but it has been corrupted into something else today liberalism grants the governement the power to enslave its citizens supposedly in the name of protecting someone else but it only serves to restrict the personal rights of some and make others more heavily rely on the governement for everything for all of you governement can fix things by simply creating another department or program or by taxing the wealthy a little more nuts just remember this government or more specifically politicians have no incentive to fix anything if they did you the people would no longer need them if they were really working to put minorities on even ground as soon as it happened minorities would no longer need them if they were really interested in creating wealth other than their own then they would allow people to keep what they work so hard for instead they tax the rich to give handouts to the poor well ive got news for you robin hood is a nice story but in the end he was still just a thief regardless of his motives,politics

look beyond the democratic country to a country that in the 1990s experienced economic collapse and turmoil so great that people had to line up for hours just to buy a loaf of bread suicides abortions domestic abuse and social malaise skyrocketed as a result of the despair and desperation rightly or wrongly there is debate among the less friendly western press putin is credited by russians for russias recovery from the chaotic 90s and for many russians who still have the misery of the 90s fresh in mind that service to the country far outweighs the autocratic tendencies of putins presidency russia still faces serious economic and social challenges russians prefer a strong man at the helm over the more civilized niceties of a mature democratic system that will likely change as these challenges are met and i would imagine medvedevs two presumed terms in office to eventually steer russia in that direction,worldnews

color consciousness is not an us vs them mentality it is a mentality which understands that racial problems still exist in america whether you choose to acknowledge it or not perceived race still modifies the experiences of americans even though it is clearly not a real biological thing for some the effects are more devastating than for others ralph nader is not saying that barack obama is somehow inherently different because hes black ralph nader is saying that even though barack obama was raised middle class he knows what its like to be perceived as a black man in modern american society it would be very hard to grow up as a black person in this country and not become aware to at least some degree that there are people who perceive you differently and will treat you differently those people arent irrelevant either they own businesses hire workers manage schools and run for government offices not only does obama by default have at least some first hand awareness of racial facts in our country he worked in segregated communities with people whose experiences were affected to a much greater degree than him by race due to the combination of race and class whether you like it or not race is a social identity that everyone is affected by and ignoring its existence as a social construction can only do us more harm this is not us vs them this is why do people view me this way this is why do i see myself like this the blind ignorance of whiteness as a racial identity has only caused our country trouble people dont even realize when their white skin gives them social capital and privilege that most nonwhite people dont really have the opportunity to acquire the question that ralph nader asks is not a new question perhaps it is easy or natural for a white middle class american to ignore the issue of race in america today but that doesnt mean that it is not affecting people it is much harder to ignore the issue of race if you do not have white skin the affects of socially constructed race are hauntingýçùþêüåâäåùöüùèçêàóúúîäçõãçàþöæâîããæþæäúåøþæûúåæøøåë could an intelligent aware human being with first hand knowledge of racial discrimination ignore that experience instead pursuing the easier path encouraged and supported by a largely wealthy predominantly white male hegemon that strives to uphold the status quo here is a videoýçùþêüåíäèùãçùöôûëöçèöê²íóêãèèûå of malcolm x discussing the same issue in some other politically incorrect terms he is not being racist though he is acknowledging the social existence of race and denouncing those who dont it would be nice to have a harsh term for white people who fail to see the negative affects of race on nonwhite individuals,politics

i found this discussion educational as well i think ron pauls heart is in the right place but the system he advocates is better for a more responsible society where people are naturally kinder to each other i dont think pauls system is a good one for a thuggish or a selfish society which is what we currently have my biggest concern is that ron paul makes a couple of factual errors consistently he stated unequivocally that socialism fails every time however the examples around us show that it doesnt he said that public education fails every time again there are examples in the world to the contrary so i really dislike his unequivocal rejection and demonization of socialism that is completely detached from reality fact is that socialism works very nicely in a lot of countries giving unlimited liberties is ideal when all the citizens are responsible however when they are not some ground rules are necessary my ideal system would be a financially responsible and market oriented government that participates in certain strategic aspects such as education medicine consumer protection and maybe some others however just because the government provides universal health care and free education does not mean that the government cannot follow ron pauls principles in every other way it doesnt have to be an all or nothing thing and this is my problem with paul hes an all or nothing guy when he criticized other systems he did so without admitting any good points of any other system and in reality there is almost nothing out there that doesnt have some good points this inability to admit even a one good point of socialism is really a huge weakness in paul it makes his otherwise interesting and somewhat but not completely sound ideas appear more desperate its like hes hoping no one will notice some of the flaws in his proposals so he cant mention that free education works well in finland because hes trying to promote something thats nothing like finland so his own goal leads him to pretend like there is nothing out there that works well besides what hes got in his head i wish i could talk to ron paul i think i could convince him to change his mind i am not kidding i dont think i could ever convince him to abandon his principles nor would i want to i agree with him on his principles but i believe i could impart more intellectual honesty and more intellectual humility on ron paul if i could talk to him over the period of a year or so obviously one discussion wouldnt be enough he would have to soften up his stance a bit and become a lot more nuanced in what he advocates hed lose some of his conceptual simplicity but hed be a lot more honest though as it stands he has to deny some facts in order to preserve the cartoonishly simple conceptual simplicity of his ideas i wouldnt vote for paul as he appears to us today but i think we need a man like paul to be at every single discussion table what he talks about should be discussed i consider him to be deluded but his delusions are different from those of others and i think its good to mix different kinds of delusions together its healthy,politics

gt it always means independence from overt rule by a government never independence from other people ever that has never been what it was claimed to mean and when its set up like that it is just to make an easy straw man to attack it doesnt always mean jack shit it means whatever people discussing the issues want it to mean if you come into a discussion with the attitude that certain generic words have no contextual meanings and instead only have the absolute meanings that you deem appropriate you undermine either consciously or unconsciously your fellow person with that arrogance out of the way let us say it means what you say it does i will pretend you are asking me nicely to assume that meaning and i consent for the purpose of this post so then if you are talking about independence from the government it could have been from oppression and oppression doesnt have to stem from the government  it can come from peer groups from the corporations and from any kind of organization really you have to analyze the problem of governance lets look at the phenomenon of governance what is governance i think a reasonable definition of governance is to say that governance is what happens when you have a formal paper trails allowing independent verification and oversight allowing reporting by the press systematic meaning its not adhoc and enforced meaning that adhering to the system it is not optional  if the system is optional it is not systematic it becomes adhoc way of handling disagreements in my ideal world i would wish that you contemplate this meaning for a few minutes in silence and all that it entails how and where does the phenomenon of governance occurs is what we call federal government or state government the only example of governance also if the federal and state governments were dissolved would the phenomenon of governance also dissolve if our issues are with the phenomenon of governance why do we focus exclusively on what we call the government and not on any and all instances of governance or on the abstract highlevel and general phenomenon of governance as it occurs until we look at these questions seriously we cannot have an intellectually sincere discussion,politics

america has all the qualifications to be deemed a fascist nation or at the very least an authoritarian plutocracy the founders were they alive today would have been leading a bloody revolt against the establishment years ago i admit i was relieved when obama won it was so refreshing to see and hear so many people excited about the election taking such an active role in it the amount of participation and interest in politics during this election was unprecedented but just why were people so interested sadly i dont think it was because they were interested in politics or the health of the nation i think this grand upsurge in interest was only due to obamas charming personality he makes promise after promise all of which give us hope that our corrupt state will change for the better but how how will he fulfill all of these promises print more money borrow more money use force the biggest problem with this largescale interest in our government now is that it isnt focused on the important issues people wanted to see the black man beat the white man to see the young guy beat the old guy to see the republicans defeated so obama won are we now under the impression that no one has to worry about anything anymore with bush gone and obama in office are people going to become even more blind to the atrocious actions of the state than they already are now if mccain had won at least more people would have been angry hell i would have been furious beyond description at this moment in americas life anger is exactly what we need most not blind loyalty and trust that everything is going to be okay because a silvertongued charmer won the presidency we cant forget that obama supported fisa the illegal wire tapping program nor can we forget that both obama and biden voted for the bankers bailout bill which is indeed the greatest heist against the american population in the nations history and did you know that obama supports a oneworld government no its unfortunately true well see what he does in time i have a feeling he is going to fuck us our liberties and the constitution hes going to take us to hell just as mccain would just in a different handbasket,politics

its not a due process issue the supreme court has reaffirmed that marriage is a fundamental right however our system of law is one based on anglo common law we attach significance to precedence and history the supreme court has not and could not rule with honesty that gay marriage falls under the concept of marriage being a fundamental right since marriage has been considered a statesanctioned institution and that definition of marriage for the better part of 5 centuries has been between a man and a woman there is no issue  unless an amendment is passed the court has its hands tied,politics

i feel proud patriotic and american for one simple reason a conversation with my friend lee lee is asian american it was obvious to me that the obama victory had a profound effect on him so i asked him if he was okay he said you know america always saw itself as great and the rest of the world was always a little skeptical because americas actions did not always match its claims of greatness tonight we finally live up to our own hype i said what do you mean he said i as a man of color may understand this better than you ever will over the years i have encountered from time to time the persistent meme that being an american means being white when someone says to me of course i cant speak chinese  im an american it means little to you but to me it speaks volumes he has an automatic association of his whiteness to his americanness but wait one fucking minute there are quite a few people like me who can speak chinese and yet are no less american than him in any concievable way in this election we saw this harmful meme again and again some whites from the south and rural areas angrily asserted that obama was not a real american i recognized the subtext easily he aint white  only whites can be real americans so of course to them he was not fit to take high office i said its fucked up i agree he continued the crushing victory proves once and for all in the most visceral fashion imaginable that the bigots are utterly wrong were finally the nation where any american regardless of skin color really has the possibility to achieve anything its no longer just an empty promise the few who still subscribe to the despicable meme will eventually die of old age some sooner than others the new generation that replaces them wont have their prejudice this is why you see so much emotion out there im all choked up because i was born here and ive been a citizen all my life but only right now at this moment can i finally say that america is my country too maybe well fuck up again down the road but today we live up to the greatness of our highest ideals,politics

the logic is flawed first we must consider that our taxes go to the public good the top three places that our taxes go are national defense by a long shot social security and health if you like numbers ýçùþêüåëößñáùõéæñôáãôáùùç so the number one place your taxes go to is defense what are we defending our country who defends it physically predominantly the poor and who gets the most benefit from being defended those with the most to lose the wealthy who has the most to spend on such things the wealthy the number two is social security which is paid out based on your lifetime earnings so even the rich will receive a social security check after retirement as set up now this does not account for privatization and lastly health which is broken down into these categories health care services health research and consumer and occupational health and safety so yes the rich are paying to keep some poor people healthy but they are also paying for advances in health research better trained professionals and osha which keeps their workers safe so its not like everyone is going to a pub and drinking a round of beers not at all and even if we assumed that it was the tax rates and reduction are wrong after the reduction this is what would be paid remember everything is done by percentages nevermind that the percentages are flat out wrong and that because of loop holes in the tax code our richest pay a smaller percentage than our middle class before reduction with the wrong effective tax rates for america the fifth would pay 1 1 the sixth would pay 3 3 the seventh would pay 7 7 the eighth would pay 12 12 the ninth would pay 18 18 the tenth man the richest would pay 59 59 after reduction fifth 080 sixth 240 seventh 560 eighth 960 ninth 1440 tenth 4720 and everyone sees a reduction imagine that now lets look at actual effective tax rates mind you this does not include the breaks our ultra wealthy get because of those loopholes from before but well roll with it anyway ýçùþêüåýçæõôêãúðýçæòãåþ äùù before reduction fifth 10 10 sixth 15 15 seventh 25 25 eighth 28 28 ninth 33 33 tenth 35 35 after reduction fifth 10 8 sixth 15 12 seventh 25 20 eighth 28 2240 ninth 33 264 tenth 35 2800 youll notice that they do not add up in nice tidy sums thats because life cannot be summed up in a short anecdote about going to a pub regardless the rich are not fleeing from america in droves because of the tax rates america has a pretty low tax rate considering our quality of life in fact the vast majority of countries with lower tax rates are thirdworld countries i dont see the rich going there to do anything other than take their resources and set up sweat shops which is morally reprehensible to me but i guess some people can spend the money they make off the nearslave labor of others to buy some counseling so they can sleep well at night but by all means if they want to move to a third world country they can just get right on that in america youre free to leave when you wish theyll probably have their homes raided and be murdered in their sleep by an uprising of the uneducated silly public education locals but at least they arent throwing their money away on silly things like police protection and if that doesnt happen then they might catch something from their water which they have to cart from the local watering hole and is not regulated they likely will get sick from the food which is not regulated by the fda they wont have paved roads to drive their rolls royce on to get to the doctor their doctors are not regulated so they wont received proper care,politics

morality is not defined by what makes us feel icky the philosopher ronald dworkin said if i base my view about homosexuals on a personal emotional reaction they make me sick you would reject it we distinguish moral positions from emotional reactions not because moral positions are supposed to be unemotional or dispassionate  quite the reverse is true  but because the moral position is supposed to justify the emotional reaction and not vice versa if a man is unable to produce such reasons we do not deny the fact of his emotional involvement which may have important social or political consequences but we do not take this involvement as demonstrating his moral conviction indeed it is just this sort of position  a severe emotional reaction to a practice or a situation for which one cannot account  that we tend to describe in lay terms as phobias or an obsession,politics

its not a hate crime if a black man attacks a white man but its a hate crime if a white man attacks a black man thats not racist or dividing at all the whole concept of hate crimes is inherently retarded and counterproductive when you make one citizen above another in the law you made a mistake and you can expect violent retaliation these are the roots of terrorism telling another man his life doesnt count as much i know the cops made the call on classifying it but the whole concept of having a special set of laws for this is retarded and results in the opposite of the desired effect,news
no its not a hate crime because the man didnt make the attack based on race i agree that a lot of the time its overlooked when a black man attacks a white man whereas with the other way around it wouldnt be but here it is simply because the only discernible reason that the guy attacked was that the old man was a mccain supporter,news

man you are a weasel you asked me how they were being treated unfairly now if i understand right youre saying that what you really meant was that theyre not being treated any more unfairly than other groups that are also treated unfairly come on you admit it they are being treated unfairly along with lots of other people yourself included,politics
so at what point does fair become unfair if the majority is being treated unfairly then wouldnt it be considered fair and the group that you think is being treated fairly would actually be treatedly unfairly why do we need to have a legal system based off sexual rightsid be ok with rites marriage as defined by religionyou know the group that started marriage defines it as between man and woman why do homosexuals feel the need to claim marriage as something other than that it would be much easier to change the law regarding civil unions than to change a conservatives mind,politics
i probably agree that the libertarian civil union idea is the best and most workable but i dont understand the conservative viewpoint on marriage or that gay marriages somehow destroy it what is it in conservative thinking that creates such resistance or is it exclusively religion marriage to me is not about cock and pussy you can have heterosexual sexual union just as easily before marriage and even have kids without getting married so theres nothing special about heterosexual sex in the context of marriage i guess if youre religious and you think it has something only to do with gods blessing of the union that follows but to me marriage is one thing and one thing specifically taking an oath or making a promise saying to your spouse i will stand by you no matter what  you are as important to me as i am to myself or more in the context of romantic love and i dont get where this very human promise has anything to do with just a man or woman nor can i imagine even if i was some kind of fundamentalist christian what two gay people getting married has to do with me as a heterosexual if indeed i felt homosexuality was a sin i would assume that sin was between the two individuals getting married and god i dont understand how it destroys or corrupts the institution of marriage i dont understand it at all,politics

im not endorsing a political ideology here but try to look at it this way there are people who are social conservatives and fiscal conservatives theyre called republicans there are people who are social liberals and fiscal liberals they are called democrats but what if youre a social liberal but fiscally conservative thats called a libertarian and the party that can be most closely identified with the policies of ron paul you see social and fiscal issues each have their own spectrum with conservative on one end and liberal on the other you can see a visual representation of this concept at åâñùýøôññôáåôøáãçúhttpwwwåâñùýøôññôáåôøáãçú ron paul is extreme but he represents a necessary political influence if there were no conservatives how can there be liberals personally im staunchly moderate but i respect the necessity of both sides of the argument because it is only through the competition between these competing ideologies that produce a happy medium that applies to both fiscal and social issues im going to assume that youre socially liberal statistically most redditors are so is ron paul so i assume you dont take issue with that without further knowing your political orientation im going to assume that you take issue with his fiscal conservatism eg the desire for less government and less governance while i respect the fiscally liberal point of view i suggest you consider the results of unchecked fiscal liberalism the money the government spends has to come from its citizens the more liberally the government spends money the more money it will have to take from its citizens if the idea that the the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one were allowed to run rampant you end up with a government that has complete control over what you produce in order to redistribute it fairly its called communism in the interest of having a moderate government we need both liberals and conservatives to have a government that is extremely one way or the other has undesirable results edit one of the reasons that i think the government shouldnt provide all of your needs is the idea of personal responsibility its the political equivalent of saying man up take care of your own shit thats one of the driving forces behind wanting less government fiscal liberals are like mom and fiscal conservatives are like dad,politics

yes the bible says that all sins are equal and that they are all worthy of forgiveness if you repent of them forgiveness comes with an acknowledgment that something wrong has been done if someone sins and says that they arent sinning and that they arent planning on ever stopping they cant be said to be repentant there is a verse in the bible where paul writes to one of the churches about one of their members the young man is sleeping with his mother and the members have allowed him to continue to come to services and join in the church they reasoned that gods forgiveness covered even the most horrible thing they could do paul pointed out that one could not be forgiven while they refused to quit their behavior he told the church to kick the young man out until he ceased his behavior i suspect that when most people throw the youre supposed to forgive argument up to christians they really mean youre supposed to be quiet and accept my behavior regardless of the fact that i have every intention of continuing as you can see from scripture that isnt what forgiveness means for christians yes i understand your point about people overlooking certain sins but i dont really think theres a difference if a person made the point that they didnt believe that their behavior was correct but they kept backsliding in homosexuality i dont think many people would be angry with them its the difference between an addict who goes to meetings and has a few relapses and one who says everyone else has a problem the bible in fact says that christians should not be critical of others who struggle with sin you may disagree with christians in regard to homosexuality being a sin but my point isnt about that my point is that christians arent hypocrites because they are harsher towards practicing homosexuals,politics

although the domestic partner act generally equalized the treatment under california law of registered domestic partners and married couples there was one significant area  state income taxes  in which the 2003 enactment did not provide for equal treatment section 2975 former subdivision g  a part of the 2003 act  provided in this regard notwithstanding this section in filing their state income tax returns domestic partners shall use the same filing status as is used on their federal income tax returns or that would have been used had they filed federal income tax returns earned income may not be treated as community property for state income tax purposes in 2006 the legislature eliminated this disparity in the treatment of registered domestic partners and married couples with regard to state income taxes by amending section 2975 to delete the provisions of former subdivision g of section 2975 and to renumber the subsequent subdivisions of section 2975 stats 2006 ch 802  2 the 2006 legislation specifically declared that it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this bill that the inconsistency between registered domestic partners and spouses with respect to state income taxation be removed registered domestic partners be permitted to file their income tax returns jointly or separately on terms similar to those governing spouses and the earned income of registered domestic partners be recognized appropriately as community property as a result of this bill registered domestic partners who file separate income tax returns each shall report onehalf 720 of the combined income earned by both domestic partners as spouses do rather than their respective individual incomes for the taxable year stats 2006 ch 802  1 subd d most recently the legislature

of the registration process stats 2007 ch 567 introduced as assem 416 bill no 102 regsess20072008 signed oct 12 2007 although the preamble to the 2003 domestic partner act suggests that the proponents of this legislation did not view the enactment as the final or ultimate legislative step with regard to the official status available to samesex couples see stats 2003 ch 421  1 subd a this act is intended to help california move closer to fulfilling the promises of inalienable rights liberty and equality contained in sections 1 and 7 of article 1 of the california 805 constitution  italics

provisions of section 3085 which the legislation viewed as applicable only to marriages performed outside of california the governor vetoed both measures fn24 although the governing statutes provide that registered domestic partners have the same substantive legal rights and are subject to the same obligations as married spouses in response to a request for supplemental briefing by this court the parties have identified various differences nine in number that exist in the corresponding provisions of the domestic partnership and marriage statutes and in a few other statutory and constitutional provisionsfirst although the domestic partnership provisions require that both partners have a common residence at the time a domestic partnership is established  297 subd b1 there is no similar requirement for marriage second although the domestic partnership legislation requires that both persons be at least 18 years of age when the partnership is established  297 subd b4 the marriage statutes permit a person under the age of 18 to marry with the consent of a parent or guardian or a court order  302 303 third to establish a domestic partnership the two persons desiring to become domestic partners must complete and file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state who registers the declaration in a statewide registry for such partnerships  2985 subdsa b to marry a couple must obtain a marriage license and certificate of registry of marriage from the county clerk have the marriage solemnized by an authorized individual and return the marriage license and certificate of registry to the county recorder of the county in which the license was issued who keeps a copy of the certificate of registry of marriage and transmits the original certificate to the state registrar of vital statistics  306 359 health amp safcode  102285 102330 102355 fourth although the marriage statutes establish a procedure under which an unmarried man and unmarried woman who have been residing together as husband and wife may enter into a confidential marriage in which the marriage certificate and date of the marriage are not made available to the public  500 et seq the domestic partnership law contains no similar provisions for confidential domestic partnership fifth although both the domestic partnership and marriage statutes provide a procedure for summary dissolution of the domestic partnership or marriage under the same limited circumstances a summary dissolution of a domestic partnership is initiated by the partners joint filing of a notice of

fiscal summary of assem bill no 205 20032004 reg sess as amended aug 21 2003 26 usc  7702bf2c the domestic partnership statute provides that nothing in this section applies to modify eligibility for such longterm care plans  2975 subd g which means that although such a plan may provide coverage for a state employees spouse it may not provide coverage for an employees domestic partner this same disparity however would exist even if samesex couples were permitted to marry under california law because for federal law purposes the nonemployee partner would not be considered a spouse see 1 usc  7 eighth an additional difference stems from the provisions of california constitution article xiii section 3 subdivisions  o and p granting a 1000 property tax exemption to an unmarried spouse of a deceased veteran who owns property valued at less than 10000 however as the legislative analyst explained when this constitutional provision last was amended in 1988 see ballot pamp gen elec nov 8 1988 analysis by legis analyst of prop 93 p 60 few persons claim this exemption because a homeowner may not claim both this exemption and the more generous homeowners exemption on the same property

a statement of decision in a recent superior court ruling that declares in part that a registered domestic partnership is not the equivalent of a marriage it is the functional equivalent of

721 806 417 of course although the domestic partner act generally affords registered domestic partners the same substantive benefits and privileges and imposes upon them the same responsibilities and duties that california law affords to and imposes upon married spouses the act does not purport to and lawfully could not modify the applicable provisions of federal law which currently do not provide for domestic partnerships and which define marriage for purposes of federal law as the union of a man and a woman see 1 usc  7 fn25 in light of the current provisions722 of federal law the many federal benefits and the amount of those benefits granted to a married person or to a married couple on the basis of their married status are not available to registered domestic partners included within this category are significant benefits such as those relating to social security medicare federal housing food stamps federal military and veterans programs federal employment programs and filing status for federal income tax purposes all of these 807 important federal benefits however also would be denied to samesex couples even if california designated the official union of such couples a marriage rather than a domestic partnership because as noted federal law defines marriage for purposes of federal law as only a legal union between one man and one woman  1 usc  7 fn26 fn25 title 1 section 7 of the united states code provides in full in determining the meaning of any act of congress or of any ruling regulation or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the united states the word marriage means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife and the word spouse refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wifethe domestic partner act attempts to ameliorate the disparity in treatment caused by federal law by providing in section 2975 subdivision e that to the extent that provisions of california law adopt refer to or rely upon provisions of federal law in a way that otherwise would cause registered domestic partners to be treated differently than spouses registered domestic partners shall be treated by california law as if federal law recognized a domestic partnership in the same manner as california law fn26 in addition to the differences in the provisions of the domestic partner act and the marriage statute set forth above  ante 76 calrptr3d at pp 720721 fn 24 183 p3d at pp 416417 fn 24 plaintiffs point out that californias designation of the union of samesex couples as a domestic partnership rather than a marriage has led at least one federal court to conclude that samesex couples lack standing to maintain a constitutional challenge to the federal defense of marriage act see smelt v orange county 9th cir2006 447 f3d 673 the federal decision in question however does not suggest that a samesex couple would lack standing to mount a direct federal constitutional challenge to the california marriage statutes or alternatively to mount a direct federal equal protection challenge to the denial to domestic partners of federal benefits that are made available to a married couple on the theory that such differential treatment is impermissible when state law affords domestic partners legal rights and benefits equal to those afforded married spouses the court in smelt instead simply held that the trial court properly concluded that abstention was warranted in light of the pending state litigation that is the subject of the present appeal  id at pp 681682 as explained below  post at p 724 fn 28 183 p3d at p 419 fn 28 in this case plaintiffs challenge is based solely upon the provisions of the california constitution and plaintiffs have not advanced any claim under the federal constitution thus in sum the current california statutory provisions generally afford samesex 418 couples the opportunity to enter into a domestic partnership and thereby obtain virtually all of the benefits and responsibilities afforded by california law to married oppositesex couples while acknowledging that the domestic partner act affords substantial benefits to samesex couples plaintiffs repeatedly characterize that legislation as granting samesex couples only the material or tangible benefits of marriage at least in some respects this characterization inaccurately minimizes the scope and nature of the benefits and responsibilities afforded by californias domestic partnership law the broad reach of this legislation extends to the extremely wide network of statutory provisions common law rules and administrative practices that give substance to the legal institution of civil marriage including among many others various rules and policies concerning parental rights and responsibilities affecting the raising of children mutual duties of respect fidelity and support the fiduciary relationship between partners the privileged nature of confidential communications between partners and a partners authority to make health care decisions when his or her partner is unable to act for himself or herself these legal rights and responsibilities embody more than merely the material or tangible financial benefits that are extended by government to married couples as we explained in koebke supra 36 cal4th 824 843 31 calrptr3d 565 115 p3d 1212 the 723 decision  to enter into a domestic partnership is more than a change in the legal status of individuals the consequence  of the decision is the creation of a new 808 family unit with all of its implications in terms of personal commitment as well as legal rights and obligations in re marriage cases 2008 43 cal4th 757 80110 as you can see except for the age and cohabitation requirements all of the other issues you bring have to do with other laws not the domestic partnership laws and should be changed accordingly at the end of the day prop 8 is a childish on

this is a good argument and does make excellent sense but it brings to mind a very recent and famous quote from alan greenspan regarding the recent collapse of the market specifically regarding regulation he identified before congress a flaw in the model that i perceived is the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works that flaw was human greed thats why were going through this now the ideology of capitalism was compromised by greed governmental regulation was minimized because of the flaw of greed just as in a financial institution a social institution needs some regulation to protect against failure the arbiters of the money need regulation you need to regulate who receives the money or else less needy but more vocal or aggressive people may take the lions share private regulation is still susceptible to greed look at the dictatorships that have built themselves on the premise of socialism the arbiters of the money worked hard to get into that position by hook or crook sometimes and once there they indulge their greed who will say otherwise to them the problem that stands between the usa and true libertarianism is that libertarianism stands at risk of falling into the same pit that socialism did and that our banks did until the individuals in a society feel true and unquestioned responsibility toward their fellow man greed will always win out over altruism and therefore the advance of a society as an ideology its great but so is socialism the problem with them is not their creed but their greed the end purpose of any institution whether private or governmental is to advance a goal in a society in my eyes its better to compel a governed society to support itself while reaping freely the benefits of that rather than allow the failings of human beings to get in the way of the noble goals democratic governments are answerable to their people ideologies sadly are often compromised to advance greed as an idea i can absolutely see where libertarians are coming from i guess where we depart is our level of optimism regarding human charity that doesnt necessarily make me right,politics
its not a ghetto version of marriage it gives you the exact same rights as married heterosexual couples get same benefits same hospital visitation rights same property rights and etcetera theres absolutely nothing different about it other than its a domestic partnership and ours is a marriage there is no difference other than its not recognized on a federal level and if you want that changed ill help you change it and yes youre slowly destroying the culture of the church that this country was founded on and you want to call us homophobic sure fine in a sense i guess you can say that but any person in their right mind would be afraid of their children growing up to be gay and going to hell for not repenting i dont think i want to see my adult child go to hell for it and i honestly believe thats where you go you have the right to live the way you want to live i dont care what you do inside your own bedroom as long as youre not forcing people who dont want to accept your unions as marriages to do so and if youre second class as you keep trying to say that you are then its your own damn fault for living a gay lifestyle you put yourself there by choosing to be different there have been plenty of people who lived years as homosexual and met a person of the opposite sex and changed but the fact is even though you like to see yourself as part of a poor underprivileged second class the fact is that youre not a second class you just dont qualify for a union defined by the word marriage man  woman  marriage man  man  union woman  woman  union its simple math what exactly has the gay community done for this country to deserve these rights you keep yelling about this country was built on the backs of poor black people and they deserved to be pissed at the unequal rights they had so many years ago what have you done lately except file frivolous lawsuits against churches who dont want to marry you because its against their religion and force your agenda to be taught in public schools waahh i want to be married even though a civil union is the same thing with the exact same rights its not good enough to be united i want to be married even though marriage is a religious institution why wont they accept ussssss qq poor little babies who choose to be different its like saying i want to be a japanese but i wasnt born japanese  you dont qualify for marriage in the same way that you dont qualify to be able to call yourself japanese if you want to pull the whole its not a choice to be gay were born that way in canada you can already be arrested for calling you people bigots and haters of religion and my freedom to be able to believe what i want and teach my children what i want is going to be taken away by you as you gain rights we lose rights i spit on you and your whole special rights movement because its doing nothing but tearing this country apart all you do is create a bunch of turmoil between families and friends who have differing opinions on the subject when you should be happy with civil unions because theyre the same damn thing i dont see any less prestige in the word united than i do in the word married and you shouldnt either you want to cry youre making us a second class fine but you put yourselves there the day i get put in jail for reading the bible out loud is the day this country has gone down the toilet oh wait they already did that in pennsylvania nevermind rightsmongering bastards youre so busy fighting for your own rights that you dont get that youre destroying the rights of other people in the process when they start teaching gay marriage in schools in california ill start home schooling my kids and if they stop that ill be sure to debrief them when they get home every day i have the right to believe whatever i want to believe and raise my children the way i want to and eventually youll just start putting everyone in jail that doesnt like the way youre living omg they looked at us funny poliiiiice arrest the dirty christianjewmuslim for looking at us funny,politics

gtthe right to marry is not stipulated anywhere but the right to be taxed the same way as straight people is im sorry but are they not taxed at the same rate as single straight people if they are then i dont see the discrepancy if they married then they would be taxed at the married rate oh but you say they should be allowed to marry but others say that marriage is between a man and woman only if there is no legal definition of what marriage is or if the definition is unclear then how does one determine how to procede 1 historical precedent originally marriage was only between a man and woman centuries of human history have reinforced this 2 current practices marriage is still overwhelmingly a institution between a man and woman in practice this isnt going to change even if other unions are allowed as they will still be a minority 3 societal opinion in the aggregate still in favor of traditional views of marriage in certain geographical areas the majority opinion may be changing 4 laws this is the best way to solve the problem with clear definitions of rights and benefits but how do we make laws either the people make laws or their representatives laws however usually follow from 1 2 and 3 and thats exactly what has happened in california steps have been taken to define marriage and everyone has an equal right to that definition a law is fair so long as it is applied equally to everyone right no one complains that a president is defined as someone who must be a certain age that is the definition of a president marriage has always been defined by default perhaps not explicity in legalese as any other definition was unthinkable at the time as a certain thing that now some people are trying to redefine thats fine if thats what the society wants but the votes have shown thats not the case the whole point of explication to wonder what rights have been taken away as opposed to what new and never before extant right to a new and never before extant kind of marriage has been denied hopefully that made sense gtyour solution would at least prevent the financial discrepancy again i dont see any discrepancy in financial terms given the current definition of marriage but beyond that ive always had the impression that this was more about recognition and perception of status equality than about finances gtbut a far better solution is for the government to get out of marriage entirely that was somewhat implied in my suggestion however consider that insofar as marriage traditionally generates children and stable marriages tend to produce more stable children citations needed but too lazy governments have always had an interest in promoting these procreative unions with financial incentives putting aside the issue of adoption for now a whole other can of worms it should be clear that samesex unions do not offer the same benefits to society note same refers to kind not quality or quantity with this in mind is it more fair to provide the same financial incentives different incentives or none at all for anyone i dont know,politics

of course i have a personal motivation in replying to you and im not worried about hiding it because its not the sort of feverpitched desperation inspired motivation that you find in the faithful when they defend their faith from a perceived attack you ever watch a movie or sitcom where the main character could easily avoid a huge mess just by coming clean with the others involved but they dont and invariably create large and hopefully hilarious drama wanna just jump on in and tell him hey man your friends are reasonable just level with them itll be okay i promise thats my motivation and im afraid you misunderstand me i dont hate christianity and i dont think god is hateful to me as a matter of fact i appeal to satire in an attempt to please him god separated man from animal in only one meaningful way ive ever really noticed and thats laughter nothing else laughs on earth not even other sentient creatures so if god made us i figure he must either have a good bellylaugh himself every so often or appreciate humor in his creation why else would the bible itself and every other religious document ever made become funnier and funnier with time no matter how many languages and translations you run it through i apologize if i hurt your feelings or made you feel belittled the appeal to ludicrousness was chosen and worded with the intent to amuse and to through amusement display how funny the bible really is as for my abstract logic i wasnt trying to win an argument or even really take a side even if i made my own opinion apparent i just wanted to help you learn how to be more suave in swaying people who dont think like you do to your way of thinking if i was to state an argument however as it seems youre requesting me to do for some reason id state this slavery is a form or persecution so is denying homosexuals the right to visit their dying lovers in the hospital get healthcare or bank accounts or loans or adopt children like any other married couple more to the point seeing as how nobody in our lifespans in america has been a slave with any legal backing when homosexuals were actively persecuted against instead of this passive legislation sorta thing we have going now they were denied the most basic human rights they were rounded up tortured and killed alongside many other minorities down the ages in fact the pink triangle some of them chose to represent themselves came from the pink triangles the nazis would pin on them to mark them as nogood sodomizing faggots personally i think the person whos argument i inherited was pretty poorly thought out id have myself pointed out that the bible passage forbidding gay sex is on the same page as the one that forbids interracial marriage and that if you go back in our country to when gays were still being committed and given shocktreatments and lobotomies against their will blacks still couldnt marry whites somehow that seems pertinent as for me being able to afford you by biblical standards i can keep as many slaves as i can feed and care for and i dont care how much you eat believe me i can cover it that said the joke aside sadly as it appears to not even have made you smile or grin id never allow it funny bible or serious bible slavery is an abomination to me edit i missed something asking about whether the slavery was consensual or not lets go with the biblical times for the sake of argument thatd be nonconsensual course in reality consensual or not i wouldnt allow it as noted above merely wanted to point out that the bible has no problem with slaves black or otherwise so long as you take care of them but find somebody else to be your sugardaddy slaves give me the willies,politics

rahm emanuel and obamas civilian security force kurt nimmo infowars november 6 2008 as paul joseph watson notes this morning obamas apparent pick for chief of staff illinois democrat rahm emanuel is disturbing in light of the fact he is a staunch supporter of reactionary forces in israel and his father was an irgun terrorist the son of a man who helped carry out this slaughter the deir yassin massacre of palestinians has now been selected by obama to be his chiefofstaff cries of sins of the father lose their gusto when one considers the fact that after the 1996 reelection of bill clinton rahm emanuel was so angry at the presidents enemies that he stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign grabbed a steak knife and began rattling off a list of betrayers shouting dead  dead  dead and plunging the knife into the table after every name sounds like a nice guy writes watson emphasis mine emanuels emotional response to clintons enemies reveals how he will likely deal with new perceived enemies as obamas righthand man in his book the plan big ideas for america published in 2006 emanuel sketches out his ideas on how to fight against the spread of evil and totalitarianism in addition to fortifying the militarys thin green line around the world by adding to the us special forces and the marines and by expanding the us army by 100000 more troops emanuel suggests we must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like britains mi5  a d v e r t i s e m e n t  obama  the postmodern coup a new domestic spying operation is an obvious threat to our civil liberties notes john walsh in response to emanuels suggestion mi5 holds secret files on one in 160 adults in britain along with files on 53000 organizations it should be noted that mi5 also specialized in the infiltration of british unions and was responsible for directing many of the iras atrocities rahm emanuels ideas on defeating the alleged specter of domestic counterterrorism dovetail with frightening precision with obamas declaration that once elected he will create a civilian security force just as powerful just as strong just as wellfunded as the us military people of all ages stations and skills will be asked to serve the us army alone has nearly 500000 troops not counting the national guard is obama serious about creating some kind of domestic security force bigger and more expensive than that muses joseph farah of worldnetdaily if not why did he say it what did he mean it should be obvious what he meant although we cannot expect the corporate media to fill in the blanks if obamas soontobe chief of staff stabs a knife into a table as a form of punctuation while denouncing the enemies of his former boss bill clinton it does not take a lot of imagination to predict how obamas civilian security force will be used is it possible the acorn does not fall far from the tree emanuels father belonged to a terrorist organization that killed the opposition including women and children is it possible this psychopathic mindset was passed on to his son and will now manifest itself in obamas civilian security force,politics

i shouldve been more clear in my original post is the right to marry anyonething stipulated in the constitution yes the right to marry is implied in the constitution based on among other things marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race skinner v oklahoma supra at p 541 in fact reading through the entire pdf you linked to discusses many situations where people tried to limit marriage the courts found that one of the few things that could be made a disqualification for marriage was potential peril to the prospective  offspring of the marriage reading the entire document finds that nearly all of it references procreation progeny and offspring  and truthfully it would be difficult to make the case that decisions from 1948 were made in any other context than that of viewing marriage as the implied constitutional right of a man and woman again the problem is not the right but the definition of marriage,politics

before people start taking the words of the israeli who wants to build this as fact the grave was not a car park there is a car park which is partially built on the grave however by no stretch is the grave yard now a car park the reason this went through at first at the approval of the islamic court part of the israeli court system was because they found no reason to object however there was a man who visited his grandfathers grave regularly and he didnt know about the construction when he found his access to his grandfathers grave was cut off he went to the court the islamic court issued an injunction that the construction must stop until the matter had gone through court the construction company refused to stop they actually broke israeli law and no one held them accountable to it from that we can conclude that the islamic court is just a farce invented by zionists to get away with the destruction of islamic heritage i know some people might argue its just a grave there are buildings built on jewish graves too but that is not the point the point is an israeliarab went to court because he objected to the construction since it was on his grandfathers grave the court issued an injunction which the construction company refused to follow to add insult to injury the spokesperson for the museum of tolerance said he wanted to resolve the matter peacefully yeah peacefully by ignoring a court order,worldnews

i wrote the following for another forum im gonna copypaste it here because it touches on this topic the republican party consists of many factions but among the more important are the conservative base and fiscal conservatives the base includes largely illiterate fundies from the deep south who are united in their love for sarah palin hatred of black or colored people belief in biblical predestination including redrawing the map of the middle east to prepare for the end times and religious values such as opposition to abortion and stem cell research the teaching of creationism etc they pay lip service to fiscal conservatism mostly in their preference of small government but as various statistics show they are mostly poor and take more than their share of welfare tax cuts to the rich do not benefit them but its part of their ideology they are profreedom to the extent of keep your filthy hands off my guns but quite clueless about other significant protections to individual liberties offered by the constitution hence they go along with government actions that abridge the 1st 4th 6th and 8th amendments they actually defend such loss of liberties as necessary for the war against turrurism or save the chillun but they fiercely defend the 2nd amendment guns give them comfort even when they are losing other liberties then there are the fiscal conservatives who pay lip service to social conservative issues such as abortion and gay marriage bans but their real interest is in protecting the money flow these are welltodo people many of them quite wealthy they want to protect high incomes and corporate profits they are also generally smarter and realize that no party can run this country without the support of middle america while the conservative base would turn off any moderate voter who came close with their blatant racism homophobia biblical certainties etc these fiscal conservatives form the buffer to middle america they are capable of putting their arguments in persuasive and nonoffensive words that moderates and independents can agree with at least until the votes are cast many of them are writers tv personalities journalists etc these are the people we commonly hear on tv the conservative base is largely hidden from middle america though it does sometimes rear its head as people saw in mccain rallies where the fundies screamed kill him you can get some idea of how they think if you peruse fundie sites like freerepublic the base calls such fiscal conservatives rinos  republicans in name only fox is a business so i suspect their philosophical alignment is more with the fiscal conservatives or rinos however every single successful election for the republicans involves energizing the base therefore there is much pandering to fundies going on specially during the election cycle at election times their interests sort of coincide the base provides the bulk of the numbers and much of the cash and the rinos provide the moderate commentary that will convince enough of middle america to vote their way to tip the election this election was different in that the fundie base really hated the republican nominee john mccain this kind of thing happens occasionally because its hard to find the perfect crossover candidate who can appeal to both fundies and moderates at the same time mccain is a bit worse than most what he calls mavericky the fundies call liberalism from hell his nomination cooled the enthusiasm of the base very considerably things were going really bad because the republicans simply cant win without the support of the base so the leadership did what they thought was a smart thing  they picked sarah palin as the vp their thinking probably was  heres a candidate whos fundie enough to comfort the base shes obscure and unknown and therefore not powerful enough to threaten our agenda shes a woman  that and her obscurity might suddenly focus media attention back on us and give us the boost we need for the election unfortunately they miscalculated palin didnt just energize the base she drove them crazy she is dumb enough to speak their exact language the words they understand shes got 5 kids shes got a downs baby she is unreservedly against abortion shes the perfect fulcrum for the antirino backlash that was building in the base since the nomination of john mccain she raised a firestorm that the leadership wasnt prepared for the conservative base cannot be reasoned with theirs is an all or none viewpoint youre with them or youre the enemy this makes it very hard for the moderate republicans right now they need the base because without it they cant win but they cant let the base take over the party because most of them wouldnt want to live in a country governed by the republican base fox is caught in the middle they are not trying to appease obama they are not trying to make up with the liberals you can forget that feelgood nonsense they are simply trying to chart a course between the two factions of the republican party the leadership is playing the blame game right now since they lost if they say mccain was a bad nominee they have to accept at least partial responsibility for it so they would rather pin the blame on palins stupidity to the base however things are exactly the reverse fox is trying to be fair and balanced between these two viewpoints for the first time in their lives and finding that fair and balanced is exactly what the base hates most fox will need to make a choice i suspect the choice will be in favor of the base because ultimately its the base that brings in the nielsen ratings that helps them sell ads and pay salaries so look for a strong propalin tilt to come after all the moderate republicans can be convinced in time that this wasnt personal its just business you could never convince the base of that to them everything is personal for democrats the best approach right now is to support the conservative base as much as possible on the palin issue this is a huge wedge that can be driven into the republican party palin is ultimately unelectable she can mobilize the base like no one else but thats her limit she knows all the words that whip up the base to a frenzy but she doesnt know the words that move middle america and she is too dumb to master them without middle america without moderates and independents the republican party cannot win a presidential election supporting palin is the surest way to ensure democratic dominance at the presidential level for a long time to come,politics

she may be a strong candidate in a primary but she will not be the winning candidate in the presidential election unless the democrats just throw in the towel yes she can energize the republican base she has already demonstrated that the problem is that the republican base and middle america are very different the republican base alone cannot win a presidential election they need the moderate republicans and independent voters to tip the scale moderates and independents hate her they are the ones criticizing her now within her own party independents think poorly of the sort of race baiting and sleazy attacks that were her hallmark we all saw the palin rallies where the people were screaming obamas a terrorist and kill him it got so bad the campaign had to tell her to tone it down this is partly why the republicans lost the independent vote she got them the republican base but lost them the moderates the base keeps saying look at how republican rose in the polls after her selection it proves that her net effect was beneficial this is a half truth its true that the base outnumbers the moderates so if she can pick up the base while losing moderates shes going to be a net plus on the polls but the flip side is that you cant lose the moderates and win the election you have to have both you need a person who can unite the base and attract moderates and independents she cant as for her drawing in republican women they are a pretty solid block already i tend to think that her net effect on women will be negative because of her position on abortion no abortion even in cases of rape or incest even some of the republican women who scream that abortion is murder secretly want it to be available just in case it will certainly turn vast numbers of democrat and independent women against her note that palin got no detectable benefit from the supposed hillary voters who were supposed to vote for the woman candidate because they hated obama,politics

completely disregarding the obvious unjustness of separatebutequal policies several states who are passing legislation to prohibit gay marriage are also prohibiting civil unions i dont believe that proposition 8 did this but the recently passed initiative in florida does gtthis amendment protects marriage as the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife and provides that no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized obviously the controversy goes far passed the merriamwebster definition of marriage and is reaching into much more complex issues,politics

you need to reread my comment i said if not eloquent as to infer that you were not eloquent and still would not be the difference is between coming off as a man whos education was cut short or who has a minor lingual disability and coming off as a man who has an unhealthy addiction to god nobody accused you of cloakanddagger deceptions i merely advised you to try it next time because if you would just have omitted that one tiny phrase your credibility amongst unbiased viewers wouldve shot up considerably i still wouldve known you for what you are a zealot with faith on his skin and doubt and fear in his heart because those who have true faith in their god do not suffer the sick scent of desperation that drips off your words growing ever more grandiose as you feel more and more threatened to hide the shriveled sad reasonless child who fears losing his tribal identity behind them the sitcom analogy is quite apt you could be so so much more than who you are but you hobble yourself im not even talking about your faith just your basic inability to understand how you look to other people your allergy to logic is also problematic in daytoday life id imagine in ways you probably arent even aware of but really in life how competent you are isnt as important as how good you look if comfort and societal success are your only goals and youre really good at faking it so i bet the only thing that could really dramatically improve your life and your arguing skills right now is learning how to tone it down a little how to throw a little guile and forethought into your words maybe even your life so you dont keep making a total ass of yourself on the internet or at least so you can start doing it in a fashion a couple more people out there take seriously as others have pointed out below me there are other animals who have the ability to laugh persay but there arent any that appreciate humor i dont know who the first person to realize this was and if i had to guess id say it predates aristotle humankind has been around a very long time and weve been jokers the whole way a lot of things are historically miscredited and i dont really trouble myself over ownership of an idea truth be told i doubt ive ever had a truly original um what did you call it discovery i dont think anybody ive ever met has either nor do i really trouble myself with ownership or take any sort of undue pride in my ability to discern the reality i live in you misunderstand me when i say the bible gets funnier with time i dont mean within my lifespan within my lifespan the bibles humor has been relatively constant with tiny spikes when people have tried to use it politically i mean since its inception as technology advances as housing materials medical techniques astronomy and physics explain more and more and alter our daily life more and more from its original audience its instructions become less and less applicable and more and more absurd its always been hilarious in my view in an archaeological context the humor drops and reveals an ancient method of spreading information to keep people out of trouble and push a political agenda at once but it doesnt have much bearing in a world like this in a world where people like you have to put up with jokers like me voicing their opinions between every serious grim and humorless hallelujah and amen i dont bear a hatred for any religion or cult a couple pyramid schemes out there piss me off like mormonism and scientology and have since my childhood but relgions themselves ive no problem with you can find a way in the bible or in the vedic scriptures the quran or the oral traditions from any culture around the world all of it is selfcontradictory all of it is too much to hold in your head at once so people pick and chose from it what suits them none of them preclude true spirituality none of them prevent enlightenment none of them stop you from being a good person responsibility for those sins lies squarely on the shoulders of those who are more interested in controlling the lives of others than improving their own selves people whod rather tell other people who they can and cannot marry than work on their own personal relationship with god homosexuality was not institutionalized in the nazi regime it was what you might call in the closet and yes little billy i knew that too if you want a more current and better documented example of this phenomena at work i suggest you look at any of the many recent leaders of family values thinking who got caught in gay scandals or roy cohn and if you look to the spanish inquisition you can see good christians persecuting good christians this doesnt really have any bearing on the argument at hand though the gays still suffered either way it does however back my assertion that god has a sense of humor especially all those good christian leaders who keep turning out gay i think if you listen closely you can hear god whispering in those happenings you dont need to deceive people really just express yourself differently dont sound like a holy roller sound like a professor approach life with some stature with some pinache with some flare and with some grace dont degrade yourself and your god by sounding like a kid on a playground playing my dad is a great and mighty dad mightier than your dad and all false dads who cometh before him my point is that you wont succeed in informing anybody if anything youll alienate potential new followers by coming off as a selfrighteous prick i dont think youre really paying attention here i offered that position in jest in good humor and spirits the biblical slavemaster is sort of a sugardaddy he takes care of his slaves and doesnt own more than he can afford seeing as how im not one to whip others i imagine id make quite the lenient master and as i pointed out i can easily afford to feed and cloth another human being so i could easily afford by biblical standards to keep a slave and since i dont believe in following the bible to the letter what it says about slavery doesnt really have any bearing on what i ought to or ought not to consider thats pretty much all youve mentioned responded to but between you and i im concerned for you and your distance from your god you havent said even one funny thing yet a person without humor is a person whos very far away from god maybe ive failed you in not being funny enough but i think the failure may not be mine alone how much time have you spent thinking about how other people should live about how other people do things and about what other people believe i think if you were truly interested in nurturing a relationship with your god and with jesus christ youd loosen up a little and start worrying about your own sins instead of pridefully and hurtfully lashing out at every sin you perceive those around you of committing take a time out man before you reply again go read a webcomic that cracks you up or listen to your favorite standup comic awhile watch your fellow man caper and cavort as surely as you do to make them laugh and bask in the upside of life in the light that is the laughter your lord has granted you maybe then youll realize the utter absurdity of thinking he needs or cares about your fumbling attempts to champion his cause and stop worrying so much about what everybody else is doing and find some happiness and mirth in your own life,politics

i dont completely agree with the author about the semiconspiratorial meme although there appears to be an element of that there are also sober intelligent leftish people who wondering about the emanuel appointment given his exceedingly close ties to israel but this from the article is also worth noting gtregardless of rahm emanuels past in which he volunteered at an idf base during the persian gulf war he is a political professional he understands unlike some other dc politicians like jane harman whos actually been lobbying to get herself named cia chief that his loyalty must be to barack obama and not to aipac or even israel itself barack obama is no fool unlike george bush he wont suffer an insubordinate staffer or someone whose allegiance is clouded or whose decision making apparatus is compromised gtand unlike george bush i think obama has a much deeper sense of political mission and agenda dick cheney was able to perpetrate his outrages due to a president who had no sense of political self that isnt the case with obama no one is going to take this man for a ride political or otherwise the author may have stated emanuels political professionalism a little to strongly  hes been guilty of bias in the past imho where israel is concerned  but the important thing to note is that obama is not gwb and hes unlikely to want to operate in an isolated informationfree bubble its that tendency of gwbs that allowed him to be so easily manipulated by those with all sorts of agendas obama is different,politics

a if people were born polygamists like people are born gay i would be more likely to support it b they arent and polygamy would require a much more thorough rewriting of the law than gay marriage which has an obvious and direct analog in straight marriage having said that im not morally against it if everyone involved agrees on everything and its a tricky issue when it comes to people who have legitimate religiocultural claims to practice polygamy having said that the major problem with polygamy is simple math a lot of polygamous societies and groups tend to have a problem because it tends to be one man married to multiple women do the math eventually people run out of wives and young men who arent getting any get pissed problems abound,politics

i should specify that i know that the christian god of the bible isnt real i cant honestly say i know there isnt some other sort of supreme being out there heres how i know im reposting this from a conversation i had with someone else at another time because i dont feel like typing it all out again first off you need to start with a definition of god god is perfect and he cannot lie prov 305 mal 36 heb 618 i could go on yes as a former christian zealot myself ive read the bible extensively it is well established throughout the bible that the inability to lie is one of gods key attributes thus if we catch god in a lie then either he is a liar or he is a fictional character in a book i dont feel like listing the multitude of instances where the bible and subsequent christian revelationteachings has been refuted by science heres a few though  heliocentrism  flat earth  age of the universe  evolution  and so on so lets take evolution as an example the bible explicitly states and the interpretation of the bible going back to the day it was written has been that god created the earth and everything on it including man after science learned that this was not the case religion followed its usual pattern they protested they fought violently over it and eventually rationalized a way for the evidence to fit preconceived beliefs thats what youre about to give me when you present a counter argument the fact is that god lied when he told his prophets to write about the creation not just in genesis but in isaiah and other portions of the bible that were written to solidify that without question god was the creator weve learned conclusively that god didnt create life on this planet at all going by the prerationalized biblical account and we have mountains literally of factual proof to support the fact of evolution so going back to the logic is it more logical to assume that god a perfect deity who stated himself repeatedly in his book that he is perfect and cannot lie lied to us about the creation and intentionally misled millions of people or that the story of the creation was made up in order to give people a sense of worth in a world of uncertainty religion is an adaptive behavior by early man that was needed to cope with the stress of the uncertainty of life that came with our increased intelligence modern christianity is simply a product of the evolution of various beliefs over a long period of time if i was a person completely unfamiliar with both sides of the argument which would make more sense to me youll need to approach this as though you dont believe anything completely unbiased if you can the answer is very clear so much so that i feel that i know god is a myth just as firmly as i know that santa clause is or harry potter people say god cant be disproven well neither can the easter bunny,politics

very defensive once again i wont go over why i think you do that again ive no fear of your faith weak or strong i promise you only what masses of people with similar faith might perpetuate think of it more as flinching at somebodys choice of gaudy wallpaper yeah it covers the walls it does the job wallpaper does but you cant help but wonder how the guy who chose it can possibly be blind to how obnoxious and illfitting it is ive met enough people whos faith involves more worrying about other people than themselves before and i know better than to try to change your mind or reason with you about how you go about expressing your codependent relationship with god i just wish you could learn to speak at room volume so to speak heres a counterargument for you mister bob jones regarding homosexuality being a sin if its a sin why does god make so many homosexual things he created all by your mythology so he must be responsible for every gay dog gay cat gay penguin gay giraffe gay turtle gay horse gay porcupine and much much worse out there i wont even get started on transvestite deer there are natural occurances of homosexuality in both man and nature if god is omnipotent why would he create a specific kind of human being and then declare it evil one that he particularly hates theres nothing about it in the ten commandments jesus said nothing about it theres more support biblically for not working on the sabbath than there is against homosexuality where do you draw that conclusion from i think youre telling us a lot less about god than you are about yourself i also think if you take a look at the relapse rate of cured homosexuals youll find it to be a rather disappointing number the homosexuality isnt the phase pretending god made them a way other than how he did usually is and i dont particularly need help in my life im not what you might call a needy person i handled my own addictions and vices as a child and as an adult i handle my business and my life just fine on my own i dont ask god to help me i dont pray for him to make the world better for me i enact my desire in the world by acting on it directly when i see a neighbor unable to afford glasses i pay for them when somebody who either couldnt afford to go to college or chose not to go to college gets stuck in a shit job that works him to the bone just to get by i teach him a trade i pay for his materials and help them get a job that is something more than modern feudal slavery when times are bad and a buddy cant handle rent i pay for that too because truth be told im pretty damn well off and it has less to do with god or jesus than it did my own hard work we were both given reason as surely as we were given humor and sexuality we all seem to have our own unique methods of applying these things and frankly nobody really cares how you rationalize the disproportionate drive you put behind your evangelizing and your desire to see other people disallowed from living how your god created them when i sin i do not run to jesus i seek to fix whatever damage i have caused because living your life by a single joke no matter how old it is and how many books there are in it is a bad joke and every joke eventually runs out of punchlines you have to admit the mormon version while still pretty funny doesnt have half the oomph of the original bible maybe the reason you need jesus help to even live like a functional human being is because god made you to be the way you are whatever the reason i know your kind isnt changeable at the core so i dont try statistics say your kind is dying out in america though so i know the ongoing sitcom that is humanity is about to enter a new season with brand new jokes one with equality in it somewhere and im content to wait for it being pretty young still myself and to someday look back at this election year to frown briefly then crack a grin as i recall the episode about scientology and those wacky b people that occurred earlier in the season i dont mind the wait or watching the culture ebb and flow as i age but if you guys could just learn some stage presence in the meantime itd really be a lot more enjoyable for everybody cmon would it really hurt you to throw a knock knock in there somewhere between the amens i dont look to moldering tomes for my morality i alleviate suffering when i can i put more of my income towards helping others than i do myself and i strive to amuse and keep people smiling i dont need faith in these ideals because theyre solid and provable thats why i dont mind having a good job and a good family having boyfriends and girlfriends at once in a big happy family in a way im lucky and so is everybody like me were completely indistinguishable from your kind we can go to church if we want and even pretend to be normal married couples if we want kids we either marry or just damn well have one with a malefemale pairing  my own family doesnt care much for statesanctioned marriage but if we wanted to fudge it we could and itd be all happy in any legislative sense you can imagine you were right earlier when you assessed that this whole debate isnt even my problem directly thing is in getting to where i am today i saw a lot of people fucked with and a lot of people hurt over skin color over religion over sexual preference at the time i couldnt help them some of them are no longer with us now my own brother straight as an arrow recently contracted hiv he got sodomized for being in the wrong place at the wrong time the details are a bitch to come by as its not exactly a simple thing to ask about but given the location theres good odds it had to do with him being white too and i promise you as always somewhere somebody is laughing it up about that it doesnt matter if you realize it or not but you are directly interfering with somebody elses way of life youre saying that their god is less important than your god youre also saying that my god isnt as right as your own god i dont mind though i get a lot of that and its kind of impossible to legislate against me so unless you guys get it in your heads to go back to holy warring and burning us deviants at the stake again you can disapprove all you like even say it to my face if itll make you feel better  point being youre not sodomizinginfecting anybody youre not enslaving anybody youre not even torturing anybody or throwing them in jail for having oral or anal sex anymore but you are doing something akin to it you are forcing people to live in ways other than how they see fit and you havent the right you havent the right because if god made this world he made it as he saw fit and as long as there are people out there who do manage to not be complete fuckups without a codependent relationship with jesus we know there are ways out there other than yours that work we know that if there is a god he made ways other than the one you walk and if we look to human history we realize that what you think of as god isnt even going to survive one more generation just like your grandparents god isnt quite the same as your god and happened to believe interracial marriage was wrong now im the last guy who will tell you how to blaspheme against your own creator or how you ought or ought not to question his wisdom in what he created to each their own vice i say but for the sake of the rest of us can you manage to make it a little more funny or at least elevate the joke a few grade levels you know you sound like the script to an episode of gi joe bad guys rawr good guys rawrback throw some by the power of greyskulls in there and ill be having flashbacks to saturday morning cartoons growing up cmon do it for the impressionable youngsters out there who need jesus in their lives be entertaining

i really hate it when people try to use the dictionary in an argument there should be some sort of fallacy associated with it definition fallacy maybe the dictionary is merely a snapshot of the language at a particular time and within a particular region it doesnt say what is a word what isnt or what a word means in the absolute sense it simply records how people used the words if people started using the word marriage to describe the social institution under which a man and woman establish their decision to live as husband and wife husband and husband or wife and wife by legal commitments religious ceremonies etc then the dictionary would change its definition to that,politics

its the other way in around in an equal wealthy society it is less likely that polygamy would occur even if legal women have less incentives to share one man much less to be owned by one on the other hand even if illegal very affluent men can afford one or more mistresses which is like polygamy without the family values,politics

gtnamely ambiguity the ambiguity you are inferring is one that is present in everything except possibly certain mathematical constructs if i say the sky is blue on a cloudless summer day in kansas you could claim i was being ambiguous by not specifying the shade if i claim that grass grows you could claim ambiguity because i havent said how or how much in this case the scenario as i see it is that a religion has scriptures that state quite unambiguously go forward in the name of allah do not kill an elderly person nor a small child nor a woman and do not exceed the bounds just because someone could look at that and say well small child would be anyone under three and clearly there is an exception for collateral damage oh and it probably doesnt matter if they are not muslims because then they arent really people that isnt an indication of ambiguity in the text it is an indication that the person who is reading it is looking for ambiguity some context with which he can justify his actions now if the general position of the islamic world were that people may be killed if they are non believers or that people may be killed if they are raped etc then i would agree that islam as a religion is hypocritical not that its texts are in this case ambiguous however given that most muslims seem in my experience  i travel a lot and based upon media reporting to hold the views that are consistant with others in their community it would seem that they like most other religious groups use a mixture of cultural and religious positions to determine their beliefs i am sure that in the uk many muslims oppose the death sentence whilst in the us i would assume many more support itnot on religious grounds but as they as individuals tend to reflect similar views as their fellow subjects and citizens as i said almost everything is ambiguous to those who would like it to be whether it is tax law religious doctrine the definition of torture the rules of the road etc the example cited early in this thread however is probably one of the least ambiguous religious passages i have ever come across,worldnews

you are misconstruing the argument a lot the other killings you talk about hardly detract from my point it is clear enough when there is no malice involved i do see that there is a difference in the way we look at societys decisions and an individuals however does this mean that its right is a societys decision infallible obviously not just as an individuals isnt so why use the only punishment that assumes it is throwing a person in a cage in their house would amount to murder since there would be no way for this person to get food and other necessities of life an obvious straw man we can and should imprison people for breaking laws obviously imprisonment can serve a purpose separating the criminal from a situation where hes likely to commit a crime again acting as a deterrent and hopefully some rehabilitation can occur killing the criminal is simply not necessary and only two of those possible benefits can ever occur,politics
gthowever does this mean that its right is a societys decision infallible obviously not just as an individuals isnt so why use the only punishment that assumes it is its not perfect but such is life society faces the unenviable task of having imperfect humans judge and punish other imperfect humans there is no perfect way to administer justice but the fear of error doesnt mean no irreversible penalties should be implemented it seems you were arguing that society should not undertake a punishment that would not be permitted by an individual but you now are simply saying the finality of execution makes it too severe however all sentences are based on the assumption that you are in fact guilty if i send you to prison for 20 years and take away 25 of your life i can no more give you back those 20 years than i can give you back your life if i execute you certainly execution is very severe and requires the utmost care and consideration when being handed down but i dont think that precludes its use gtthrowing a person in a cage in their house would amount to murder since there would be no way for this person to get food and other necessities of life an obvious straw man i was referring to kidnapping when an individual does it vs incarceration when society does it same thing but one is considered justified when done by society rather than an individual i didnt mean to imply starving a person to death,politics
gtwhatever is written down in the history books and whatever happened does not change what muhammad used to tell his men before going to war go forward in the name of allah do not kill an elderly person nor a small child nor a woman and do not exceed the bounds so how do you know he said that are you arguing that a religious book must be fact whereas a history book is incorrect,worldnews
well that is interesting because according to ibn mâjah muhammed said tell him not kill children or laborers and according to albûkhârî ibn umar said i saw the body of a slain woman during one of the battles of the prophet may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him so he forbade the killing of women and children and according to anas b mâlik muhammed said before sending his men to battle go forward in the name of allah do not kill an elderly person nor a small child nor a woman and do not exceed the bounds ill look into that other hadith you have but from passive inspection it appears the raids were being carried out at night resulting in collateral damage so it could just as well be that if collateral damage is unavoidable then nothing can be done about it it is also worth noting another hadith on muhammed attitude towards children of nonmuslims gtthe angel of the mountains made to allahs messenger may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him that he would bring the two mountains down upon the inhabitants of mecca allahs messenger may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him said no i hope that allah will make some of their descendants worship him alone whether you believe the events occured or not it does make clear muhammeds stance on the children both born and unborn of nonbelievers it can further be supplemented by the fact children are regarded as pure regardless of their lineage or parentage,worldnews
no im not saying a history book is incorrect but our interpretation of history today is based on events that took place 1400 years ago therefore our interpretation could be inaccurate based on missing bits of data for example it is a fact that muhammed ambushed a caravan no one will deny this as it is historic fact where conflict occurs is some historians say this is an act of terrorism others will assert that the caravan was going to supply the enemy as for the words of muhammed the hadith as its known is often times extremely authentic because the words in the way they were passed down from one man to another can easily be pinpointed right up to muhammed that is why hadiths are often written as such and such said on the authority of such and such who heard the prophet there is a lot of care taken and most of the hadith if not all from sahih al bukharis many volumes of books are very much authentic and can often be traced right back to the prophets own mouth some hadith we are not certain about since through the passage of time scholars have grown suspicious about either the way in which it was passed down or whether it was made up completely also i cant prove this but im fairly sure even religious extremists do not question the authenticity of al bukhari and they themselves would rather misreprsent the hadith as found in his many volumes of books,worldnews

i define the mistresspolygamy scheme as a relationship the the patriarch somehow owns the mistress by providing for her also he has to afford the time and alibis if its a secret so even only one mistress is very expensive and of course it only works when there are very few people who can afford this if there are many wealthy men around the available and attractive mistresses become increasingly scarce and the price of keeping a mistress does at some point exceed the benefits by far also this is not to be confuse with a love affair between socially equal peers there the exchange currency is not money but passion sex etc a equal wealthy society with regards to the mistresses problem is a society where differences in wealth are small enough that the incentive for women to become a financially owned mistress is to small to matter the women would rather marry a less affluent guy then to play second fiddle to a richer guy also the supply of sufficiently attractive woman has already dried out since they are primary wifes to the relatively rich guys this whole discussion not meant to be degrading to women and only applies to the subset of the population who find this patriarchal approach acceptable i wouldnt,politics

well yeah scratches head i think my point is that polygamy is bad in a patriarchal society for the same reasons that patriarchal societies are bad in general  it oppresses half the population polygamy in a society that had overcome most if not all of its patriarchal oppression of women wouldnt be a bad thing im not practicing polyamory now but have in the past and i remember many people in the community being very concerned about the fact that you rarely saw polygroups of one woman and multiple men it was far more common to see one man with several women or to see groups of couples who switched partners among themselves this didnt seem to fit our ideas of what we were about  we believed that people were capable of loving more than one person at a time and we didnt think gender had an awful lot to do about it unfortunately we were all still prey to a lot of patriarchal notions,politics
gtif polygamy were more socially excepted far fewer men would have mates this is not necessarily the case not all polygamy would end up with one man and multiple woman it could be one woman and multiple men polyamory is basically polygamy without the multiple marriages and there is no standard relationship ratio of men to women each group decides for themselves how they want to structure it,politics

1 it says nothing about that in the bible 2 people have been saying its a sign of the end every couple generations because these rules are completely arbitrary and change every couple generations 3 theres similar historical background behind all but one of the verses that condemn homosexuality ranging from targeting only one particular act of homosexuality to targeting it in specific places to mistranslations which i promise you will come to be more popular knowledge as the world changes this next iteration the most popular one found in leviticus in the same place as the verse i quoted to you wasnt even from christ it predates christ its old testament and its not the damn word of god either its the word of what more or less equates to laws created by the judicial branch of the jewish government and honestly nobody really truly knows for sure how it was meant to be interpreted all evidence is sketchy at best all we do know is its the word of man and the law of man read your bible and when youre through rationalizing how laws made by man that predate christ can be interpreted to your liking while steadfastly ignoring that fifty years ago people were having the exact same argument we are now with people interpreting the interracial bits to their own liking you can jump from the ever popular leviticus ban on interracial marriage to deutoronomy 73 and explain it for me there too bear in mind all this predates christ so youd best get your story straight before rationalizing this time seeing as how youre a bit of scholar perhaps you can also explain this one to me leviticus 2018 i once messed around with my girl while she was on her period it was dark i didnt know smelled a little funny but it wasnt til sunrise that i saw the sheets flipped out and nearly called 911 from all the blood now i will confess this was an experience i couldve gone without but do me and her really need to be exiled from america for it when you say i need to confess my sins to jesus is this what youre talking about is this what your god cares about why do you care about some of this insane writing enough to go indianajones archaeology on it and the bits that you like you pay no scrutiny you are a link in a chain stretching back thousands of years that chain has a beginning we can find it and go even further back to find the echoes of other chains that breathed lived in magnificence and died like your chain the values and definition of god changed from generation to generation and elders always complained about their own respective chiliasms the end of your chain isnt in sight but the link you are attached to is at its end the really hilarious thing about this is that by the last links definition of god you would be considered impure and hellbound if you married out of your race the last link took that very seriously the link before theirs wouldve condemned them too for not burning people at the stake and persecuting heathens for allowing other beliefs a degree of tolerance the link before theirs goes back to england to one of many forks in the christian faith where by the beliefs on both side of the fork the other sect was the hellbound one every link has been convinced their path to salvation is the right one and any deviation is incorrect none of them have the historical knowhow intellectual honesty and logical facilities to realize that if even one of these links is right if their brief snapshop of history was the right one that theres going to be about 1 generation of people in heaven and everybody else is going to hell like every single one that came before you and like every single one that will succeed you you think your rationalizations and interpretations are the right ones taking the word of your fellow man and fellow sympathetic historians to be the literal word of god without a thought or care to the necessary impreciseness and imperfections of their work and as always the more voracious faithful are quite obsessed about their own chiliasm with a sort of youll all see in the end tone to it your church isnt dying yet this is the age of zoroaster the manmen his history is about as clear as homers whos paradigm gave birth to the mechanisms by which your religion and others like it are so successful and its not over yet nothing new is rising to replace it the nambypamby pagan revivals in western countries isnt strong enough and the flow of eastern ways of thought into our country while having a steady warping effect arent strong enough either your church will go on like shamanism until agrarian priesthoods like agrarian priesthoods until citystate priestly classes like citystate priestly classes until godly figureheads like we saw in egypt and again at the head of the catholic church a step backwards through history that was and so on and so on until we see what its successor will be the next link is just going to look a little different because gays are doing a good job of proving their humanity in this country and your generation is doing an awful job of passing on your own rationalizations and biggotry mostly because of what i stated earlier you all sound exactly the same and that way is crazy you sound like a crack addict with god substituted for crack nobody wants to be addicted ergo nobody wants to be like you as you appear not that it really matters because theres a newer friendlier generation of christians brewing where even the homophobic are willing to let fags be fags as long as they dont have to look at it or deal with it some of them even agree with you that the whole thing is a sin and the bible calls for their death but just like you have strayed from the bibles instructions by not demanding fags be put to death and instead settling for nitpicking legislation that just ensures theyre secondclass citizens theyre also straying from the bibles instructions by just not wanting to see them kiss in public care to wager on what their kids will think of the subject theyll think except for the jesus cleanses all sins no matter what even if you were hitler and pinochet and pol pot all rolled up into one crowd that you and everybody like you is going to hell for interfering with the freewill of fellow man and they will have their own biblical rationalizations for why they do what they do dont worry for my soul hell take my advice and dont worry about yours for that matter if your faith is as steadfast as you think why worry its assured right you gave yourself to jesus he forgives and forgave you go kick a puppy if it suits you

ron paul actually has no education in politics or importantly economics if you had an education in economics youd understand why ron paul doesnt get more support sorry but i agree he speaks well and he is likable but most of his ideas are wrong or incomplete to the point that they would do more damage than good i like the idea of small government but it has to be done intelligently not with wild cuts as paul suggests it has to be done with equality not in a way that makes states and corporations too powerful in relation to the federal government the idea needs to be that states the feds and corporations are balanced in power that idea is more important than any economic model because without balance eventually even wealth cant save the nation pauls views on income tax and the federal reserve are also ridiculous he refused to accept the idea that private industry corrupts itself instead blaming government time and time again but most insulting to him and his nation is just recently when during this economic panic ron paul was out there claiming the next great depression is upon us he even made this ridiculous claim that their bailout would cause another great depression that is academically total bullshit and even more important perhaps its blatantly scare tactics no matter your position on the economy you do not in a time of crisis beat the great depression drum those are not the actions of an intelligent man ron paul is mostly a politician from my perspective also the idea that an 800 or 12 billion bailout would trigger a great depression really shows how little ron paul knows or cares about educating himself when it comes to economics the nations net worth is over 100 trillion dollars what fool would really suggest that adding 800b to our 10 trillion dollar debt is the tipping point when you have banks out there running debt ratios of 301 the idea that you can blame government spending either shows you have an affinity to blaming government or you simply cant do the math even with the us long term debts our debt ratio is no more than 61 vastly lower than these corporations weve been blindly backing for the last couple decades consistently loosening regulations on their assets pauls stance on backing the dollar or linking its value to gold again shows his lack of economic knowledge this is a common mistake in layman economics gold just like the paper dollar primarily has an agreed upon value based on  nothing you cant eat gold or build houses out of it its value is mostly tradition in some economic crisis it goes up and in some it goes down this is because these markets are trend based not logic based gold is timeless but its industrial uses are limited and it along with any commodity can be manipulated and inflated gold would fare no better than paper money with an agreed upon value they are in essence the same if you want a dollar backed by something real back it by drinking water or corn something people actually need to survive gold is a just another rich mans commodity the reason it does well is primarily because during economic crisis thats where rich people put their money and doing so actually causes the economy to crash harder that is just a form of making money off economic declines it has nothing to do with gold as a necessary commodity gold silver diamonds these are but shiny rocks and metals which society does not need to survive economies are fuel by healthy workers not gold scams i would agree the current administration screwed up trying to use its economic powers to perpetuate our economic boom low interest rates in the face of a housing crisis was a horrible idea but its not an idea that requires the federal reserve to happen given a fully free market economy all this could have and would have eventually happened banks will always seek to lend beyond their means falsely convinced by what they think is a strong economy that cannot decline banks can still bundle and sell loans in a free market banks can and will still merge in a free market in my opinion they would have gotten together and formed their own federal reserve without the government so they could manipulate interest rates themselves and cause artificial booms in times of prosperity all these ideas seem like good ones and private industry and government alike are prone to greed via simple human nature sadly ron paul will only address government greed when in reality most of the money and therefore greed in the us is tied up in private corporations many of which pay very low taxes compared to the individuals and workers that actually turn the big wheel of us economics,politics

i cant speak for mormons but with regard to all churches a lot of churches do very very good public works for the local population cutting into their funding will for the most part cut into things like soup kitchens youth organizations camps holiday assistance for the needy in the form of toy drives assistance for the elderly in the community having a hard time with medical bills etc etc sure some churches spend their cash on a fancy vestibule rather than food for the homeless but for the most part they do a lot of good also contrary to what you seem to believe the organizations they support are frequently nondenominational case in point several years ago i worked for a company that teaches science to young kids as a special after school program in addition to classes during the summer we would run full fledged minicamps with a few dozen students per location all coming to see teslacoils and build rockets several of the locations that we used were in churches especially is some of the harsher areas of town thus i found myself teaching third graders about basic quantum mechanics and evolution in church activity rooms i might not agree with some of their views but the fact is that most nuns and clergy get into it because they want to serve not just god but their fellow man most also survive on donations making them a good consideration for tax exempt status in their own right so the churches that have mandatory fees that you need to pay to become a certain rank of member the ones that use their cash to support cult fringe versions of mainstream religion the parishes that feature singing televangelists that try to sell you prayer napkins at 3999 a pack those guys deserve to be scrutinized the overworked clergy in the city that are paying out of pocket to help cover repairs to their youth center leave them the hell alone edit in response to about two dozen questions regarding tax law here is the irs official position on churches and tax exemption statusýçùþêüåýçæõôêãúðýçæþéúããéô,politics
gtif it was okay to slaughter the men and boys of the banu qurayza tribe they were slaughtered under jewish law the best you could say is muhammed was complicit because he did not object to the torah being used to execute people of the jewish faith as for the hadith you have linked to it appears to be related to collateral damage muhammed always told his men before they went to battle that they should spare the lives of noncombatants it was brought to his attention in the case of night time raids that it was difficult if not impossible to avoid killing innocent people so muhammed basically clarified that collateral damage where unavoidable is acceptable as for 911 that is definitely outright unacceptable because im sure youll agree with me here the attack was exclusively against civilians and even if not was carried out in such a reckless manner that we must conclude the perpetrators were hoping civilians would be killed as such no its not justified at all as it goes against muhammeds direct teachings gtabû dâwûd relates from anas b mâlik that allahs messenger peace be upon him would say the following words to his troops before sending them to war go forward in the name of allah do not kill an elderly person nor a small child nor a woman and do not exceed the bounds,worldnews

truth be told im more than a little conversant as far as the historical context of the old testament and the difference between ceremonial law and godly law was explained to me prior difference is it was explained to me by a rabbi so its got what you might call an older feel to it 2000 years or so give or take a couple centuries the main points ive been trying to make are mostly flying over your head or being deliberately unaddressed and ignored i dont expect you to realize your place in history as just one more holder of an arbitrary set of beliefs you dont wholly realize that the bible is a living document that changes every generation and has been since before its inception and that everytime things get more lax existing christians split into two groups one whore happy to just stop having a codependent relationship with the lord and start learning to take more responsibility for themselves and one who think theyre backsliding sinners whore going to hell lead by false prophets and a sign of the end times sometimes on large scales that span continents sometimes within a single neighborhood you can understand that youre different than those who came before you your stance on violence shows that but just like them a more lenient next generation is a sign of the endtime as well as the other signs of the endtimes you arent mentioning because at heart you know they rest on nothing but baseless faith with respect so far as its possible to say it your critical thinking is damaged overwhelmed by circular logic that upholds a set of principals that have no greater foundation in reality than the words of other men and the shadowy instincts that live beneath every human mind it works better and better the further from those circular pieces you go as is typical in those who possess any critical thinking skills and an addiction to god but it still makes certain possibilities imponderable to you for me and myself if the lord wanted to make himself known in this fashion frankly he shouldve made me more gullible and less cunning and presented his word to me himself thats a hell of a request i know sounded arrogant to me the first time i arrived at it but it makes sense by his own logic humans are fallible sinful and petty most of us cant get a damn thing right in our own life most of us flip a lightswitch everyday but couldnt tell you how and why it works most dont care they just take it for granted that itll work they take everything for granted man is fallible and the god i see when i look straight into the reality he mustve created if he is real paints a much different face than the one i see in the bible the one i see in the bible seems obsessed with controlling the minutiae of human life seems to want to make people easy to control a disaster to everybody not like them hence the many many many zealots the bible has spawned through the ages and above all resistant to change and new ideas reality tells a different story it says learn about your surroundings and grow strong to try to become more than you were born before you die and of course it says life is funny like i mentioned earlier it also says that no matter how high or low your search the truth about god is that you cant prove or disprove his existence even though we have minds capable of grasping proof which if he exists he mustve given us does that mean to have faith blindly with no evidence past other men of mostly gullible stock men who squander what theyve been given or does it mean to live as if there is no god or maybe does it mean youre meant to be honest admit you dont know that in all reality nobody truly knows and just learn as much as you can while youre alive whichever of the three i know it doesnt mean to take on faith the word of other men i also know that today in my time in our age you can look backwards and if youve an open eye to see such things devoid of prejudice you can see the many many many many cultures of men who did just that who took on faith what others said each one saying for the most part that their way was right that their method through the labyrinth in the cave of death was the only way to ascend to heaven with the chiefs at the heart of the volcano that only through being baptised their way could passage to heaven be granted that only through ascending the stick that rises through the back of the beast that guards the underworld may you join the bird people in the clouds that only through the copper placed on your eyes upon your death could you pay the ferryman that only through having your organs placed in the proper canopic jars in the proper order and way and only with your name affixed to your coffin could you rise to your proper station in the afterlife that only through following the eight ways discovered by us may you avoid all 16 of the hells that follow life and be reincarnated to a higher karmic station that only through knowing the name of the guard of the cave of the underworld could your spirit avoid being consumed by him that only through dying gloriously in battle could you wait for ragnarok in valhalla  that only through knowing jesus can you be saved most of those myths are not just older than jesus many of them are older than the god of abraham altogether and countless others have been forever lost all the way back to when man in either his simplicity or elegant enlightenment didnt even think of death as an end anymore than they regarded birth as a beginning at the end of the day to anybody who doesnt see your god in their own head already not one of those is any more or less provable or silly than the bible though as noted earlier they do tend to become more hilarious with age the fine details of that maze and volcano one are particularly silly really stretch the credibility that one does theres dancing in it too in a volcano for eternity but i digress ive plied the gifts ive been given that i was created with and through doing ive thwarted almost every standard i was told i could not thwart im selfeducated without so much as a high school diploma to my name and i not only cut it in a high pressure career full of people with masters and doctorates who cant find a job i thrive in it even during recessions ive seen people play by the books do as they were told and end up to their ears in debt and completely unemployable as anything other than interns jobs i took when i was fifteen maybe we disagree on where it begins and the word of god starts but we both agree the word of man is ultimately fallible and with good reason to me people like you look much like addicts as im sure youve gathered you get your salvation and i dont question that i question the ruleset you inherit with it when its plain to anybody and everybody that that ruleset is totally arbitrary and constantly changing by the decree of man and man alone and the many other unnecessary and restricting rules that prevent you from just making the world a better place with your own two hands and without a bunch of holy baloney about who needs to live what lifestyle to be holy ive heard jews talk about whether homosexuality is frum christians and mormons alike talk about whether theyre gods creations or abominations in need of death and many other crazy debates on various sexual subjects with nothing considered canon except the written and spoken word of other people no self no thought and all i can think is whats more likely that a god that created all this cares about humans and sex this much or that humans have a goddamn preoccupation with their own genitals im not gullible anymore than i am stupid or willing to simply believe whats easiest or the most convenient and what is realitys cannon to you is nothing more to me than one more tradition until something more reliable than man tells me its more and all the while reality itself whirs on and on endlessly and the more i look at it the less any of you look right religion is a good one a real kneeslapper ill grant you that and a great tool for organizing people but in terms of truth i think mankind at large has been getting further and further and further away as theyve strayed further and further from the idea that what is is as it was and ever will be when human sacrificed was performed not in faith but in misplaced certainty that life and death were interchangeable endlessly becoming one another eternal i think their way of handling it left a lot to be desired and philisophicaly its full of holes just less holes than anything we see today that anybody truly practices to chase moksa is to chase death while living to chase christ is to give up common sense and touch with reality for community to chase god through the oral traditions of the hebrews is to try to shoehorn reality into a mold that barely worked for people back when it was current to chase understanding through stupor and delirium through drugs and herbs is to confuse neurology with reality to admit that we do not know everything that even the most basic questions where do we come from why and where do we go are things that neither science faith nor history can tell us is to stop chasing an escape from reality and to just live,politics

i had a fairly interesting lecture today in my ancient religion class on this topic in this class the main assumption which i agree with is that because the bible was written with major concern to policies necessary to keep an ancient nomadic tribe civil and unified in its various exiles as such the rules outlined in it do not translate well in parts to our modern world today we were focusing on the commandment not to covet a neighbors wife and we followed a tangent to the bible on homosexuality as it was originally interpreted when christians reference the sodom and gomorrah story as proof homosexuality is such a problem morally according to the bible they miss the real point of the story the problem in the city is not the men wanting to have sex with the strangers it is the reason behind it and that it is a rape the men are going to rape the visiting angels not because they have an attraction to men but to show them whos the boss he pointed out another biblical story from judges i believe i didnt note it sorry in which the men of a town seek to rape a woman for the same reason and are punished by god if god punished sodom and gomorrah for homosexuality then he punished the other town for heterosexuality he also said that when jesus referenced homosexuality as a problem it was not in the same relationships we see today what jesus refers to is more the graecoroman understanding of homosexuality in which only the receiver is considered gay the word used actually translates closer to one who is repeatedly the receiver which was a colloquialism for a prostitute in my professors opinion and my own the bible and jesus say almost nothing on the more current understanding of homosexuality which does not exclusively refer to masterslave or older manyounger boyman or gay sex merely for pleasure in a current understanding of homosexual relationships being for most all of the same reasons as heterosexual relationships between the involved people the hebrew bible and jesus say very little except that is a problem because it does not produce children,politics
thats a bunch of malarkey it wouldnt surprise me a bit if you were on the lds payroll obviously you are invested either economically or spiritually one would never capitalize the word church except to give it greater emphasis than it is due like it or not the church is very equal in their reporting of the media i think what youre trying to say is that the corporation known as lds is as veiled as they can possibly be when reporting the news so that they are mistaken for mainstream media if the lds had any hand in funding promoting or engineering anything of a political nature it completely devalues whatever thin strand of christian standing it clings to why is separation of church and state so important because politics are what we create when we are unable to accept religion as the ruling party whats wrong with religion as the ruling party look around you republicans arent just about being closet racists and warbent gun nuts look further and you might see just how much the rest of the world governs by islamic judaic christian etc ideals we americans are at war with terrorists whose chief complaint is that we are offensive to their religion and their god that same god that they profess to serve is the same god that christians and jews claim to follow look it up its not hard the torchbearers of islam and christianity are opposed and the hero of judaism is mia but the role of creator is always the same god but back on point churches meddling in politics are just mans ways of saying god has failed and needs our help maintaining rule maybe its the weekend maybe god is on vacation or something lds doesnt know but they think god hates gays so they should hate them too because then hell love them more theyll be his special people i cant say i understand the sexual predilection that is homosexuality i can understand how a man can love a man or a woman another woman and i dont care if its a genetic anomaly or a fluke of nature the god that is centric to the primary populations religious belief system would not use gay as a tool of hate hate is not in the god camp gays dont give a crap what you call it union marriage or civil ceremony they want us to accept that unconventional love is possible is it unusual that different religious groups would also like to be accepted on equal terms in the eyes of god and man how ironic is it that a group of supposed christians viewed to be outsiders by the greater christian community would make such an effort to alienate another group of outsiders from attaining acceptance from the greater community dont boycott utah dont hate okay you got me started bythewar but not all of this is pointed at you i am intolerant only of intolerance,politics

gt commandment not to covet a neighbors wife a possibly interesting sidenote as was explained by someone more knowlegeable in this than i while newer versions have tried to soften the langugage in a strict translation of that commandment god prohibits coveting the neighbors wife along with his donkeys slaves and other property in a separate commandment god prohibits coveting his house  which referred to his health or wellbeing so not only is god explicitly referencing and implicitly condoning slavery but he is categorizing a wife as property of a man this is somewhat surprising and a bit different than the interpretation as probably understood by the majority of fools that proclaim to adhere to the bibles teachings,politics

i understand the sociological historical and cultural significance of marriage if it were up to me i would defer to those definitions marriage ought to be between a single man and women a civil union occurring between same sex couples should carry the same rights and privileges as the former you need to understand that this is not a cultural or moral argument this is a legal concept supposedly devoid of all other considerations equality and equal protection cannot be abdicated because some people find it uncomfortable or offensive the law of the land is one way disagreeing with is fine disobeying it is another something else entirely btw im still a little lost on your olbermann comments,politics

there is nothing inherently wrong with polygamy except where the _reality_ of polygamy boils down to a man _owning_ the women he marries it is nothing intrinsic but before you allow it you have to make sure it is hard enough to turn it into something that exploits people the other issues against polygamy are practical the lawful framework of marriage will be a lot harder to apply fairly to a marriage between more than two people once you get to issues like divorce and child support it adds a risk that polygamous marriages cost society more to support than marriage between two people im not going to dignify your point about marrying an animal obviously thats not even in the same ballpark,politics

i dont see why a man marrying more than one woman suddenly makes it so he owns all of them yeah thats how polygamy used to be  but also how monogamy used to be as well if in present times several people want to all be married to each other as one big clump to use the dharmaampgreg joke then why should society stop them just as olbermann said why go against love why not let it exist i agree about the practical issues  child support divorce etc that needs some taking care of but i dont see it as in theory unsolvable and it isnt a reason to oppose polygamy in principle it might be a reason to oppose it until these issues are fixed though gt im not going to dignify your point about marrying an animal obviously thats not even in the same ballpark i will dignify your comment with an answer you say it isnt even in the same ballpark and you so very easily let yourself ignore it but that is exactly how the majority of people used to treat interracial marriage  as something so ridiculous as to not even be worthy of debate the same used to be true of gay marriage but that is now changing and yes it should be true of types of marriage that seem to you to be bizarre what exactly is so wrong if a group of people believe that marrying animals is legitimate animals and people do love each other and some people believe that the love they feel for their partner animal is just as real as the love a normal person might feel for their human significant other as olbermann said why should we argue that they are wrong why not just be ok with their love if they and the animal are happy and doing well again it cant be any more simple what you say against marrying animals was said against interracial marriage and is still being said by many people against gay marriage but why not accept that not all people are alike and even if you wont treat them with respect why not let them live their lives as they choose how does it harm you that other people marry animals,politics

actually its the opposite prop 8 has the government going into churches and demanding that marriage exists only between a man and a woman churches who want to perform a marriage between gays prop 8 bans and yes there is at least 1 church in california that does this is all about the churches forcing their moral view on what marriage is on everyone else and not the other way around,politics
the issue is that prop 8 takes the ability of churches to have a marriage between gays away from them prop 8 has the government dictating to churches what constitutes a marriage if they really felt government should stay out of it then they should not have the government deciding that marriage is between a man and a woman if a church performs a marriage between two men or women who is anyone else to say that isnt a marriage why should the government interfere with the church and say you cant call that a marriage,politics

no you are not following me here there are two issues first is a marriage as such right or wrong it may be it is also completely out of the scope of this argument because that is a pure value judgment i dont have patience for value judgments second the question of a contract regardless of what that contract entails bear with me i implied said anything about people not being able to enter into a contract with each other i honestly do not care what kind of contract you enter into with anyone  it is a purely business transaction as far as im concerned and as long as it obeys certain basic laws applying to all business transactions its not my place to legislate it beyond that and since i believe the law should not differentiate between men and women it is not the place of government to give a rats ass about whether your contract is with a man or a woman whether i think it is right or wrong is completely out of the equation the government ie the people applies laws to contracts governing their validity and applicability as such the government by definition gets involved  including in some of the aspects you mention however holding certain kinds of contracts to different standards than others is not acceptable ive probably repeated myself several times thanks to reddits small edit window now do you often nitpick in arguments with people who probably agree with you,politics

men who will never be elected or have control over anything major my post in september said that if obama thinks this is the wrong thing to do and does it anyway so he can get elected then that certainly raises an issue id want to know what the motivation was if he simply didnt think it was a bad idea then i question his judgment it is possible that he thought it was a bad idea but also thought that he would either be able to control how at least some of the money was distributed once in office or that he felt that it was a small price to pay in comparison to what else might have happened if he truly believes that he is the best possible leader for the country and perhaps he was right does that justify doing something he thinks isnt the best plan in order to get there i realize that it calls his ethics and motivation into question im not here to stick up for him it may very well be that he is just another slick lyingass greedy scumbag politician or not give the man a chance i think hes going to be a good president and im all for principled action but lets be realistic do you think that an honest decent person who is honest and forthcoming all the time could get elected president of this country,politics

state governments should issue civil union licenses that say a couple executing the document are entering into a legally binding relationship that includes yadda yadda etc etc basically what is now called a marriage license and this license should include a space for the couple  if they choose  to list the religion church and minister that appended the church contract its version of holy matrimony to the union those not seeking a religious ceremony could have the union executed by a justice of the peace magistrate or whoever the state authorizes to perform marriages if we really wanted to be mean about it all those people claiming marriage is a religious union between man and woman would have to get their divorce certified by their church before they could file for a legal divorce in court there would be a whole lot of fundamentalists living in sin it is hypocritical that they want marriage to be a religious union but divorce to be a civil dissolution,politics

will probably get downmoded for being the vocabulary cop but consecrate  to make or declare sacred set apart or dedicate to the service of a deity i think the word you are looking for is consummate consummate  to complete the union of a marriage by the first marital sexual intercourse now if that doesnt get me downmodded what follows surely will but hear me out as christian i am opposed to homosexual behaviour and believe that marriage is rightfully defined as being between one man and one woman i dont want it presented to my kids as normal i dont really dont care to see it paraded about in the media as being the new cool thing nevertheless after some reflection i came to the conclusion that the state should not be managing marriage to begin with because it is a christian concept therefore as interpreted through the lens of the the bible two people of the same sex can never be legitimately married any more than i could legitimately be bird just because an ornithologist waves a hand over me and pronounces me a bird the consecration of a union between two people as a marriage is within the realm of the church not the state so as much as i am personally opposed to homosexual behaviour i am becoming equally opposed to the state managing marriage the state needs to get out of the business of issuing marriage licenses and instead simply recognize civil unions still i do believe that there should be restraints on state recognized unions  no close relatives defining a minimum age no multiple unions no humananimal unions etc this was not an easy position to come to but it seems the only logical one,politics

would agree yes there is a reason for that but not because people have some kind of prescience about the issue but rather that we just havent simply gotten about changing our traditions again this relates to the assumptions that underlie leftwing or sophisticated or currenthowever you frame it thinking the assumption is that there is no truth that its all just mental constructs that can be changed arbitrarily tangent thats a necessary argument because leftwing thinking is about social changeits about subverting the patriarchalcapitalist structures so intellectuals have taken this backdoor approach by undermining objectivity itself look into those midcentury french philosophers they were socialists the discredited philosophers who came before recognized that humanity has changed very little in the past 10000 years brain structures remain consistent across time race ethnicity and geography so too do the structures of human society remain remarkably consistent theres a reason why people have to cite isolated tribes from africa or papua new guinea to offer any examples of deviance from the basic pattern people generally prefer attractive people features of which generally include youthfulness fitness which means thinness and femininity or masculinity societies favor malefemale relationships because that is how human biology works you just arent going to find a societyoutside some remote galapagosin which children were taught that male and female are interchangeable and that malefemale relationships are not the ultimate ideal its only in very recent times that human beings have developed the tools needed to extract ourselves from nature and destroy our environment in this way leftwing people almost always believe that we have transcended biological forcesthat evolution no longer applies to us and we can just do whatever we want just because we drive to work and have electricity in our walls do you have any idea what egotism is involved in that belief how ridiculous it would appear if a caveman held the same belief i control fire i am god rah rah you would laugh him back to his cave and that is what nature is going to do to us we know how to make a gay society by the way segregate males from females until theyre over 30 thats how the greeks did it and they were probably the gayest society ever im not sure the dissolution of gender has been tried yet but if the 1970s are anything to go by id say the results are pretty gay i cannot understand your thinking i literally cannot understand it because every other statement you make strikes me as dangerously wrongheaded and inconceivable for example weve had these kind of objections to societal change in the past and our society through with it and we lived on these kinds youre talking about interracial marriage right or segregation ethnicity and race are nothing compared to gender nothing remotely similar we are talking about what defines male and female we are talking about basic reproduction and the familythe fundamental unit of our society this is not about gay rights its about a polar shift in the fundamentals of humanity its a big fucking deal id rather undertake what i perceive as a small risk then to deny my neighbors something as basic as marriage where do you get the notion that marriage is a basic right and that itthat specific termshould apply to malemale or femalefemale couplings where do you get it because its absurd to me it is absolutely absurd try to imagine the claim that motherhood is a basic human right that men should have the right to be mothers that though they did not give birth to a child they should be legally registered as the mother and receive all government benefits of motherhood that we should change the dictionaries to include men as mothers because after all the dictionary only defines things try to remember for a moment that this is a political fight it is not and has never been about basic rights its about redefining deviance its the most recent gambit in the identity politics movement which seeks to change the psychologicallinguisticcultural content of our society so that gay becomes normal you can support that agenda if you want but i would really appreciate it if you at least recognize that thats what the agenda is about the law shouldnt be about moralizing i agree with this but not this because we can never agree exactly what is right and what is wrong beyond some major issues like murder or theft the law shouldnt be about moralizing because thats an inappropriate use of the law government is not wellsuited to policing or enforcing morality that said banning gay marriage is not about moralityits about social policy it is unfair to paint every opponent of gay marriage as a biblethumping godfollower and its counterproductive because while you attack mormons rational people sit and watch and say im not a mormon i have good reasons to oppose gay marriage and then youve lost and then theres a backlash just like there has been since this gay marriage agenda started look at the headlines over the past five years the antigay backlash is welldocumented polling data shows it if you dont believe the polls look at the legal measures that have taken off since this started five years ago who would have imagined any state banning gay marriage you need to be happy with civil unions show some respect and admit that marriage is between a man and a woman sorry gays dont get to come to that party but they do deserve all of the legal protections a committed relationship entails like visitation and insurance and so on meanwhile dont cry sour grapes and try to ruin marriage for the rest of us while i agree that government should not engage in social engineering though i do think the promotion of traditional marriage has genuine social benefits i dont think this is the right time or reason to dismantle that institution you want my scifi theory i think were going to have the equivalent of stateless communism once home manufacturing takes off people are going to want less and less of government as we become independent from social structures like employers and schools maybe a hundred years from now government will be totally incapable of saying anything about marriage unless it goes the other way and we end up with a fascist dystopia in which case all marriages will be taco bell,politics

total utter heartbreak for a gay friend of mine last night i spoke with a good friend of mine hes a gay man who is about 55 years old he had for many years fallen in to the trap of believing he had to act straight and be as straight as he could he even married and had two kids later and many years ago he came out and has lived as an openly gay man for a long time now he thought he had a really good relationship with his kids and that having raised them to try to be tolerant and loving they would return these attitudes in their associations with him from previous conversations with his daughter over the years he thought that she accepted him and his homosexuality last week he was heading to a southern city with his boyfriend and they stopped off to visit the daughter and her husband the treatment they received from the daughter and her husband was horrible apparently they have changed dramatically having had their bigotryhatred whipped up into a frenzy over the past few months of televised homophobic republican talking points and mormons and catholics pushing proposition 8 in california the husband was insulting and openly hostile the daughter made no effort whatsoever to uphold a more caring point of view or to even say theyre guests and hes my dad lets at least be civil nothing after a few minutes my friend and his boyfriend left their home   rejected tearful possibly even humiliated the daughter and soninlaw are strong christians now i guess my gay friend was choking back tears as he told me all of this hes still hoping to reach some kind of understanding with his daughter but it appears for now as though she has chosen to treat her own father as a villainoutcast in the name of her religion i have to wonder how either one of them sleep at night the same goes for anyone calling themselves christians while still acting this way until the day i die i will fight the republicans the mormons and even the more hateful wing of the catholic church because so many of them are vicious hypocrites they deserve the kind of treatment they have caused for my friend if there is a hell let them burn in it edit i dont really mean that last sentence i dont wish pain or harm on those who hate us im just very very angry and im so tired of feeling like we need to plead to be treated just as others are what a waste it causes,politics

aw did i hurt your feelings you complain about ad hominems then end up using one nice going here you are the notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the constitution or the writings of our founding fathers on the contrary our founders political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs certainly the drafters of the declaration of independence and the constitution both replete with references to god would be aghast at the federal governments hostility to religion the establishment clause of the first amendment was simply intended to forbid the creation of an official state church like the church of england not to drive religion out of public life  ron paulýçùþêüåàúêýèßìøñúäàþæéáõïúàíèâß this is so wrong its laughable the first sentence is 100 false the only time the constitution mentions religion is to specifically bar the government from involvement with it article vi section 3 amp the 1st amendment thats it the writings of the founding fathers say much about the separation between church and state so again hes grievously wrong dangerously wrong he clearly hasnt read much madison or jefferson or is hoping that we havent the founding fathers beliefs were not informed by religious belief to create democracy enforce freedom of speech or freedom of the press because these concepts do not originate in any religion so hes deluded about that too the founding fathers were almost all deists which is by no means anything close to a believer in the literal truth of the bible as paul is and most of them were freemasons which philosophy is distinctly heretical the declaration of independence mentions god just twice if you include the deist phrase creator the constitution never mentions god at all this is not the definition of replete  maybe ron paul is thinking of a different constitution paul thinks that hostility to organized religion was a foreign concept to the founding fathers so again he probably hasnt read much by thomas jefferson and thomas paine history i believe furnishes no example of a priestridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes  thomas jefferson all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit  thomas paine jefferson even rewrote the new testament leaving out all of the miracles and nonsensical supernatural bits no luck for paul there either it seems ron paul wants to remove all regulation from corporations and businesses  deregulation is what has been the major cause of our current economic crisis it would also take workers rights back to 19th century standards  no wage controls no health plans no time off no safety controls etc sound good to you sounds fucking stupid to me and he believes the literal truth in the bible which says a lot since anyone who reads it with an open mind and critical thinking faculties can see that it is horseshit unhistorical myth ron paul is a creationist he is therefore by definition either mentally ill or stupid take your pick he may well be closer to the constitution than anyone else in dc but that is faint praise since they are all almost to a man a pack of ignorant bastards what ron paul most certainly is not however given the above quote is a constitutional scholar he also allowed racist rants to go out published in his newsletter for years and when called on this made the excuse that the material wasnt written by him and that his office was too far away from the source of publication for him to control so on top of everything else he apparently hasnt heard of a telephone either the ghostwriter for his newsletter was lew rockwell btw so you can shove ron paul fandom up your ass if you think hes so great you dont know shit about him or the subjects he talks about hes a crank and is rightly treated so by anyone who knows the truth,politics

let me preface this by reiterating that they are disappointing from a theological perspective i have no problem with obama having these beliefs as it relates to the man he is or the president he will be obviously these beliefs have served him well and i think hell make a fantastic leader i also dont doubt his faith and he may very well have a deep relationship with god but here are the items that dont agree with the generally accepted christian interpretation of the bible gt i believe that there are many paths to the same place and that is a belief that there is a higher power a belief that we are connected as a people  my mothers view always was that underlying these religions were a common set of beliefs about how you treat other people and how you aspire to act not just for yourself but also for the greater good the wording here is vague but the best way i can interpret this is that he believes that christianity is not the only way to heaven or another way of putting it is that he seems to believe that many religions could all just be different ideas about the same higher power and that many can be right there are many references in the bible that indicate that god is the only god and that jesus was god incarnate and that belief in him was the only route to salvation this is a big one the first commandment is you shall have no other gods before me  exodus 203 jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me  john 146 gt jesus is an historical figure for me and hes also a bridge between god and man in the christian faith and one that i think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher none of this is technically wrong but conspicuously absent is the statement that jesus is god jesus frequently claimed to be god and as c s lewis said this means that jesus was either a liar a lunatic or lord if we dont believe he was god then he could not have been a great teacher because he was either deceiving his followers or he was insane he could not be gods conduit in either of these situations more on that here ýçùþêüåùëøçøèêêüùøâòüýçøøüüäôçôéèôþíèâß also the entire gospel of salvation is dependent on the premise that jesus is god because thats the only way that his death could pay the price for our sins without believing jesus is god you dont believe in the gift of salvation which essentially means you are of the jewish faith rather than christianity gttheres the belief  that people havent embraced jesus christ as their personal savior that theyre going to hell  i find it hard to believe that my god would consign fourfifths of the world to hell  thats just not part of my religious makeup for the wages of or punishment for sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through christ jesus our lord  romans 623 throughout the bible there are many places that insist that man is sinful by nature and incapable of reaching heaven except through the acceptance of jesus death as payment for their sin its understandably not a popular viewpoint among nonchristians but that is the teaching of the bible gt sin is being out of alignment with my values this is another huge one god defines sin as actions that are out of alignment with his values not our own plenty of murderers and rapists and child molesters are perfectly in line with their own values but that doesnt make it right its great if obama has a strong set of personal values and he clearly does but those do not replace gods when it comes to defining sin if we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness if we claim we have not sinned we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives 1 john 1810  hope this more clearly explains my previous statement while i cannot claim to know the mans spiritual status with god i can say that his theological beliefs are far from the teachings of jesus even if his daytoday practical morality is very similar and this would indicate to some that he is not a real christian though by following jesus moral teachings he arguably is more of a christ follower than many of those who are born again for his sake it concerns me that he doesnt seem to understand completely what sin is or what it means to accept salvation which would indicate that while he may learn a great many things from the bible his soul is not currently on its way to heaven i pray im wrong or that this would resolve itself during his lifetime either way regardless of his faith i still can see that hes a great leader for this country and im proud to call him my president,politics

partial birth abortion is a medical procedure that was given a name by the prolife movement that makes it sound atrocious it is like renaming the estate tax the death tax the reason partial birth abortions should be allowed is because they are safer than the alternative say a women is in a position where her health is suffering and she needs to have an abortion to keep her safe she used to have two options one being partial birth where they induce labor and when the head leaves the uterus they strangle the fetus while still in the birth canal this is now illegal so the option you are forced to use now is for the doctor to use forceps to reach into the uterus and crush the skull of the fetus this has a 50 percent chance of the forceps piercing the wall of the uterus and making the woman unable to get pregnant again for the rest of her life now if put in the situation would you rather do it the safe way where you can get pregnant in the future or do you choose the way that has a 50 chance of ruining your chances of getting pregnant again and causing internal bleeding either method is terrible to think about but we should allow women to be as safe as possible when put in a terrible position,politics
firstly no im british i dont support any one of your domestic politicians over another its not my place to however yes for what its worth i think he was the better choice of the two in part because of the hope and change however neither of these are predictions about the future unless you consider change to be specific enough to be a prediction in which case you should go and check exactly what prediction means and hope is about the mindset of the present upon which the future may be built with hope comes trust amongst strangers and a reduction in the level of fear this allows for a more constructive dialogue between different factions of society increasing the chance that there will be beneficial social change this doesnt suppose to predict the future but create a present that is most conducive to a better future this has nothing to do with a false ability to be able to see into the future and more to do with an underlying understanding of politics and psychological social structure point that i would certainly look for in a political leader like obama so no i would totally refute this similarity that you point out and would suggest that it a result of not looking at the matter with sufficient consideration or critical thought secondly you then launch into some strange argument about us having a collective future i didnt for a moment suggest we did i said this was a time of uncertainty about our collective futures whether our future lie together or not is irrelevant to my point the fact is none of us rich or poor can even approximately see the future given this time of great global change again just should you misunderstand i am talking about the ability to say tomorrow will be like yesterday in times of stability this may hold true in certain places at certain times in times on instability it ceases to be even a an approximate model thus we collectively have to face an uncertain future and the psychological ramifications on the present that that brings to the fore this was my point not about us marching towards some common goal that was your presumption not my point thirdly and unrelated in any way to my original point your concept of the rich vs the poor is rather a shallow one it would accept that you think that these are solid social constructs and are somehow immune to the change that we see in all other aspects of life this perspective may serve as a valuable political framework if i would want to confuse and rile the masses for cheap political kudos but it is far from true the indian farmer may be poor today but his children may outsource work to the us the american may today be in the position of dominance but tomorrow may be fighting nuclear fallout or social collapse try eating your gold bullion then and see how far your social dominance today helps you tomorrow in essence you seem to mistake the transitory for the permanent obama himself descends from kenyan workers akin to the indian farmer you describe and yes the mighty of today may fall in an equally dramatic fashion the gossip columns are full of such stories and that last point re the socialist dream what are you talking about i can only guess that you are an anti intellectual american and as such use terms such as liberal and socialist in an aggressive political albeit nonsensical manner as terms to label people as opposed to your social group but really what the fuck my original point was in regards to the inability of man to predict the future you confused and misinterpreted it and went rambling off on your own to use it to denote my political opinions i would suggest that you need to stop and think a little before reacting to the world in future as in more than one way you appear to react to what you think is there rather than is it helps its what separates us from the lower animals and you are not going to help me lol oh mighty one you have no idea who you are talking to i assure you i do not need your help but would recommend that you dont go around telling people how you arent going to help them if things go bad it doesnt sound cold hearted it just sounds stupid im sure you were very happy with your post and were glad to have crushed my obama supporting socialist dream i will try to come to terms with it i presume you are a republican yes i look forward to seeing how you misconstrue the points ive laid out here,worldnews

heres how im thinking we can go for more real than real if normal everyday vanilla existence is the center of the cuil scale then negative cuils exist when situations contain true and useful information about reality in greater quantities and on more levels than generally present for example say that you have a conversation with a homeless man and the things that he says can be interpreted on multiple levels all of which are absolutely accurate and constitute an unusual level of depth in understanding of the nature of reality basically take all the dimensions that comprise reality at a baseline where you can add depth of realism you have negative cuils,worldnews

i mostly agree with you but i want to pick at a few statements if you dont mind gt the buddha was a man this is problematic buddha was once asked what he was and he refused to answer when asked if he was a man he said that his mind was free of the mental formation that would consider himself to be a man gt even the reincarnation cycle is problematic its not that problematic if you understand why buddha supported this idea it has to do with the fact that buddha wanted to stress personal responsibility as opposed to nihilism in buddhas time many people thought that since at death the stream of causality is destroyed it was ok to do whatever they pleased in life because the death will free them from further experiencing the results of their actions buddha did not like this kind of thought formation buddha took a somewhat moderate stance on causality he was not a determinist like many hindus in other words when asked whether our current actions firmly establish what will happen to us in the future he negated that but when asked if then there was no correspondence between what happens to us and how we act he negated that as well in my opinion this is not a bad stance to take but buddha didnt go far enough in this area buddha didnt analyze intentionality as well as he could have if you are interested in analysis of intentionality you can ask about it and we can discuss it essentially intentionality is completely magical and is beyond all structured causeeffect patterns and if you can conceive unstructured causeeffect patterns its almost like not having causeeffect to begin with because to us causeeffect is understood as a structure within experience and i say almost because its possible to experience experiential islands within which it appears that causeeffect works as we think it does however one is wise to recognize that it is based on nothing at all and has no inherent substance either and thus is empty like any other visionary experience so a view of reincarnation should be understood in my opinion as simply making what we call death as just any other experience not special in any way in other words death is no more special than having an itch or than seeing a blue sky its not the end of anything any more than any other experience is the end of anything else so if one understands this removal of specialness from the experience of death one understands reincarnation,worldnews

your position you also did not link to your source so people would not be able to check if you were being truthful without having to go out of their way to do so thats dishonest you are using the public perception of wikipedia as a trustworthy source to mislead them about what is actually there it is tantamount to what antievolutionists do when they grab a quote from einstein in which he discusses god and use it to claim that even a genius like him believed in intelligent design for example a popular one is i am convinced that he god does not play dice id people use this to say that einstein denied the randomness of evolution when in reality he was talking about quantum physics and never expressed a belief in id at all they rely on the publics perception of einstein as a genius and by hiding the context while still using his actual words people are often convinced of what they are claiming about his views on life just as you made it difficult for others to determine the full context of your initial evidence they too rely on the fact that when people are confronted with a reputable source they will usually not bother to go out of their way to track it down and confirm it

when you intentionally strip out the qualifier of a sentence you are forcing it out of context in order to change its meaning what i really said is that privacy is in place to achieve the goal of protecting peoples beliefs and the ability to act on them i even went on to say in a follow up post that i did not disagree with you the key aim is to ensure the voter records a sincere choice by forestalling attempts to influence the voter by intimidation or bribery ýçùþøóüýàüõóéýöôàììüðçúöóùóôñúôè a key aim is what we usually refer to as a goal by the way you cant have that sort of negative statement as a goal  so claiming that i stated the goal of privacy measures in voting is one more time not to make sure they stay secret is devoid of any actual meaning just as my goal is not to make sure to do push ups doesnt reveal any actual intent either gtin the interest of brevity i selected the most pertinent factual statements from one of several related wikipedia entries regarding this issue you selected the facts pertinent to your side of the argument and hid the source that is inherently dishonest if this was a trial it would be thrown out for misconduct via the suppression of evidence you had evidence against yourself and chose not to reveal it to me or other redditors you indicate as much when you admit to actively choosing which facts to present which is of course impossible if youve not seen other facts from which to choose and since all the other facts on the page supported my statements that proves the intent was to deceive gtyou then proceeded to inject a straw man nonsequitur into the discussion with your comment about wooden houses it wasnt a straw man it is something we like to call an analogy see i was saying that the purpose of the secret ballot is to maintain the sanctity of democracy democracy is only effective when the people are allowed to vote on their true and honest beliefs without fear of reprisal and this is achieved with the privacy of a secret ballot and other similar voting methods you seem to be saying that the reason for privacy is privacy and you quoted the definition of a secret ballot as the reason for a secret ballot that doesnt make any sense a person doesnt run in order to run you dont build a house in order to build a house this is redundant you are saying that we have secret ballots in order to keep whats on the ballot secret and that is redundant you are equating the how with the why i am saying that privacy is the how and the protection it offers is the why thats where my analogy comes in i am saying that we build houses to shelter us and protect us just as a secret ballot shelters and protects our beliefs in other words the why you are saying no that is wrong a house is made of wood just as a secret ballot relies on the foundation of secrecy which coincidentally is also made out of wood which is absolutely correct but it is not in conflict with its purpose the why the only thing i am getting from you is that you think i am accusing you of being wrong about the definition of secrecy i am not here trying to prove that you are wrong about what political privacy is i am trying to prove to you that the two statements are not contradictory the problem is you keep falsely announcing what i am trying to do which is what a straw man actually is fyi you are putting words into my mouth and when i try to clarify you just attack me instead of the substance of my argument you thrust i parry and then you try to turn my parry into another opening if you were doing this with honesty and facts instead of merely lying about what wikipedia says and calling me a troll it would be a proper debate as it is you are merely sullying yourself and reddit with your intellectual dishonesty and succeeding in misleading people as well sadly and i am simply not going to allow you to pull me down into the mud with you to cut you off here before you suddenly go ah ha i have caught you out you have just insulted me to try and tar me with the same brush of intellectual dishonesty i will point out that i have only recited fact and truth i have not once resorted to calling you names or inferring you are merely mad i have only pointed out the irrefutable fact that you took the only line from a wikipedia entry that agreed with you to any small degree and used that as your entire evidence while at the same time hiding the fact that the rest of the article supported my argument as i have now confirmed that you are in fact being dishonest and not just careless since you have admitted to only choosing evidence which supports you set up straw men resorted to insults in every single reply to me some of which you eventually edited out when your karma went negative and worst of all ignored irrefutable fact i will leave you here before i take my leave however i want to state once again that i do not disagree with you when you say that secret ballots afford privacy because they do and that the fact that such privacy is used to protect the legitimacy of democracy is not in conflict with it either,politics

just a couple more thoughts on your final thoughts to me not recognizing homosexual marriage is simply saying that we dont accept that they are married in the eyes of god and this is constitutional how again this nation was founded by christians but it wasnt christianity that brought us here it was religious persecution so do we now just turn around and give other people the same shit we went through is that christlike is that what god wanted last i checked god gave us free will and free agency so that we could choose to follow his word and itd actually mean something if he simply forced his word and beliefs on others do you think most people would give a shit no its the sense of selfaccomplishment and selfworth you get from following god that makes people better we live in a democratic society and it is an undeniable fact that the majority of people do not wish for their government to condone homosexual marriage we arent imprisoning these people denying them medical care or making them wear little magendavid patches we are simply saying that we dont want the entity the government that represents us the people to the world condoning their actions no but what we are doing is refusing them specific rights that any and all irresponsible shitty even murdering straight peoplefelons can have that makes a whole lot of sense to me additionally i find the idea that allowing gay marriage somehow condones gay marriage is ridiculous and unintellectual sorry but i dont think its very hard to separate church and politics yes at church homosexuality is wrong and should not be accepted in a church that finds it sinful but in america the land of tolerance it should be yes this is a democratic society but when the people themselves are being unconstitutional actions must be taken to preserve the intentions of the us constitution additionally the majority of americans still wanted slavery during lincolns time why was that abolished democratic process democratic process oh wait i thought thatd win the argument p and again the vote in cali passed with 48 to 52 that a big enough minority in the eyes of the us constitution whats next allowing brothersister marriage too cousins animals polygamy wow ive never actually seen someone use this argument though ive heard it but this argument is so incredibly naive ignorant and fucking retarded brossis  there is enough scientific evidence to say that this is clearly unsafe for any potential children that might be spawned im fine with incest remaining illegal because it can inherently fuck a child cousins  theres more and more evidence suggesting that theres really little to no additional risk of having a weird pregnancy if 2 cousins conceive however again im fine with this remaining illegal until evidence disproves all weirdness but either way its funny that this argument gets brought up by religious folk because what they believe would inherently mean they were fine with incest to get the world population going but somehow its dirty filthy now but really all thats bad is the complications that can arise animals really you dont see the difference between 2 grown intelligent men or women deciding to get married to say a grown intelligent man and a stupid goat who doesnt even know where it is what it is or who that guy is this is the most offensive and just fucking stupid argument against gaymarriage ive ever heard an animal cant make an intelligent decision when it comes to marriage and sex bestiality and animalmarriage is clearly wrong to use that demeans humans as a whole and makes republicans and people like you who use this argument look incredible naive and stupid polygamy depends really polygamy can be okay in a situation however how polygamy is practiced today in these compounds is obviously horrific however ideally if 2 or 3 women or 2 or 3 men loved the same manwoman and were down to be together with everyone i dont see why they cant have that right course tax benefits and stuff would have to be greatly redefined for all marriage types but for the most part i think polygamys not good as id feel that many of the women or men being part of it would have been talked into it or gone with it out of fear of losing their partner or something gay marriage does not present these types of scenarios you are not denying someones right by not recognizing their sinful relationsip as a marriage your doing them a favor you are denying their rights they simply want to be together as a couple and they feel they deserve the same rights because they too are human beings and they are believe it or not and how is stopping someone from sinning itself a favor for them simply not sinning does not bring one closer to god if we banned smoking does that make all the newlyforced nonsmokers closer to god even if theyre jewish or muslim or something nonchristian its only through faith and then choosing to live gods seemingly arbitrary set of rules that well actually get closer to god homosexuals will not be closer to god for not having been married even if we outlawed gaysex it would not bring homosexuals closer to god the way we bring homosexuals and everyone else closer to god is to live by example and to spread the word of god to convince them that what we believe in is the true godchurchetc then through conversion theyll too realize that homosexuality is a sin and will then choose to refrain which will then bring them closer to god,politics

what makes your experience extraordinary nothing you have said indicates that your experiences are anything other than commonplace you are certainly more intelligent than average and your rejection of some of the more prevalent notions about reality indicates a nonconformist streak but these are also common enough especially in universities libraries and coffee shops you have yet to discuss a concept i was not already familiar with as for truth i was not precise in my choice of words and i meant to only use the words whole or abstraction in accordance with your choice of language you perhaps have more in common with plato than you realize as the notion that there are these wholes or abstractions to experience apart from the details from which they are derived is originally his insight how does your abstraction differ from a platonic ideal moreover your blanket assertion that plato was a moron is laughable the entirety of your belief can be summed up as a specific instance of the allegory of a cave in which you are claiming to have walked into the light of nonobjecivity while i am yet chained in the darkness of materialism if you cannot understand plato as a product of his times of course you will assume he is a moron many of the old philosophers wrote things which seem absurd to the modern man but this in no way negates their intelligence or value you would call a man whos ideas have generated discussion for millenia a moron such arrogance in one who has accomplished so little,politics
there are at least as many kinds of liberalism as there are of conservatism the author has done so much cherry picking and straw man erection its hard to know where to start but lets just look at this one set of characteristics of madness _1 creating and reinforcing perceptions of victimization throughout the election republicans never took responsibility for their faults but always cast themselves as the victims of a hostile press postelection republicans continue with the victimization card with rush limbaugh for example claiming they have been victimized before the new president has even taken office _2 satisfying infantile claims to entitlement indulgence and compensation the most fervent detractors of a progressive income tax are republican trust fund babies who never earned a dime in their lives _3 augmenting primitive feelings of envy the entire republican way of life is dependent on feelings of envy hence their propensity for extravagant consumption and chants of drill baby drill _4 rejecting the sovereignty of the individual subordinating him to the will of the government for 8 years republicans have been ratcheting up the power of the government over the individual and have managed to create the most expensive government in the history of mankind the author might be right that some forms of liberalism are madness but its clear that some forms of conservatism are also madness,politics
gt you would call a man whos ideas have generated discussion for millenia a moron such arrogance in one who has accomplished so little well lets examine two different meanings of the term arrogance  its a tendency to diminish the importance of others compared to oneself in that sense i am arrogant because i cannot honestly consider all people as important as i am simply because i prefer my way of thinking so strongly to that of others so for example if i see some assumption as unwarranted and another person doesnt see that and even refuses to examine that assumption that person looks stupid in my eyes and as a consequence i will indeed consider that person less important i may then proceed to call that person a moron because thats how i feel so if you believe that everyone should be respected equally and i obviously dont then i can be said to be arrogant but then most or all people are arrogant i do give most or all people some basic level of respect though as you can see i continue discussing things with you even though i dont think were talking on the same level i dont disrespect you even if i call you a moron its obvious i read what you say and respond pretty directly most of the times this is obviously limited by my unwillingness to be even more verbose than i already am  its a quality of thinking that refuses to examine assumptions that takes things for granted and is ok doing so or that lacks the interest sincerity and tenacity necessary to conduct a proper questioning of an assumption in this sense i am definitely not arrogant but rather very humble and modest in fact its precisely because i think most everyone else is arrogant in the second sense that i appear arrogant in the first sense  unlike truly arrogant people i do accept criticism if its cogently presented and doesnt appeal to character or popularity or other things i consider to be bogus,politics

im catholic and youre a moron listen lets make it simple youre right on the fundamental account that enabling someone to commit a sin is itself a sin hell the law calls it aiding and abetting and puts people away for it so its in mans law as well however you have to qualify it roe v wade was decided on constitutional grounds not grounds based in us code or some other law the constitution okay so any law that crosses it like oh clintons pba ban will be overturned as violating the constitution in order to actually do something useful in this area youll need a constitutional amendment that requires the president both houses of congress and _twothirds_ of the us states legislatures to agree to _specific wording_ to get it passed guess how many times thats happened in almost 250 years couple dozen what are the chances of that happening with a democratic congress nil zero zip zed therefore considering that no progress can be made and that its already 100 legal there is no further damage that can be made on that front and we must consider other humanitarian issues that we can actually make a change in like say _the freaking war_ thousands of people are being killed in that pointless endeavor and it needs to end similarly thousands of people here at home are sick and dying because of a lack of basic healthcare and money would mccain have changed any of that his _policies_ say _no_ he would _not_ therefore since obama cant make the issue du jour worse and hes said that hell step in on those issues when mccain would not he is the most moral choice for any reasoning voter god gave us minds to think dont disrespect the man by letting it lie fallow these are complex times with complex issues and consequences and we must be engaged fully to participate and do what good we can,politics
sorry that doesnt follow its a natural process that she was aware of and began presumably willingly it is therefore truly her choice to start it once started its a life and its not a choice any longer well in most cases shouldnt be threats to life and mental health excepted just because it does something to the woman that it doesnt do to the man doesnt make it her choice it makes it more of her problem yes but both parties are involved in it and it it _at the very least_ _their_ choice then beyond that whose choice is it really to decide if another human lives or dies forget religion think ethics whose choice really yet thats the game thats played we take great care when separating conjoined twins to save both people because we know that while theyre feeding off each other and theres usually a weaker one both are alive and deserve life yet we ignore this fact when its something more mundane like a child kind of depressing really,politics

if you think its a life then you think its a life regardless of whether its the result of consent or rape its logical to think that fetuses should be protected whether theyre the result of a rape or whether theyre the result of two people having consensual sex i mean of course a woman who becomes pregnant via rape wasnt planning on becoming pregnant but then the issue becomes from the prolife perspective should she be forced to have the baby versus should the baby be forced to die because heshe is the result of a rape,politics
it would have been far more wrong to bring a child into the world with two parents who already saw the cracks forming in their relationship it would have been far more wrong to allow our own mistake to become a lifetime of pain for an innocent baby would it have been far more wrong for her to carry the child to term and give it up for adoption i understand its a deeply personal question for a pregnant woman and her partner to ask and sometimes a woman cant for whatever reason carry the child to term at all but i hope adoption wasnt completely out of the question when you found out she was pregnant,politics

gtyour existence meaningless without god is it excuse me the theologian says muhammad was likely to have never existed not god furthermore being a shiite and seemingly ignorant of orthodox islam it makes sense for him to come to false conclusions such as this gthe was struck he says by the fact that the first coins bearing muhammads name did not appear until the late 7th century  six decades after the religion did while shiites allow it it is illegal in terms of orthodox islam to have any depiction of muhammed or any living creature really so it makes sense for it to take so long for coins or even paintings of the man to show up as orthodox islam lost its grip on the populace no less if this is the sort of evidence hes using to prove his argument then anyone who actualy sides with him claiming to be rational are being anything but as a rational person since being an atheist seems to give you that automatic right surely you know better than to belive any random dude who says something against virtually every historian muslim or otherwise or are you the sort of person who will sooner believe the earth is a cube than round because it is less conformist,worldnews

i wonder if this whole issue would be resolved if instead of trying to get the right to marry which for all eternity has meant the union between a man and a woman  if a constitutional amendment would be put to a vote that would say we recognize the union of same sex couples as a garriage and hereby state th e legal condition of garriage shall have all the rights and repercussions of the union know as marraige under the law personally i think that would pass in a heart beat the prop 8 only passed by what 5 more than half those people simply voted against it i believe becuase they didnt want to change the meaning of the word marriage  not becuase they didnt want anyone to have the same rights to form a union with whomever they pleased of legal age and ability to consent so if its the rights the activists are after why attack those who want to protect their rights to maintain the definition of their malefemale relationships and as traditional marriage isnt that taking away a core right too if activists dont think the word marriage should matter to heterosexual couples then why are they fighting so hard to change the meaning and if they do recognize the word matters how can they not then see that they are taking something away from malefemale couples who got married under the traditional definition why the need to change the meaning of the word if it is the rights that are sought or is there another agenda desired why would anyone proud to form a same sex union be upset if it was named with a word that indicated it was a same sex union i dont understand the lack of pride in defining the union as a union between a same sex couple with a word like garriage what are you trying to hide the fact that you are married to a same sex partner why why try so hard to adopt the word marriage to a new meaning the only reasons to use the word marriage instead of something like garriage seems to me to be a desire to adopt the good will of society that goes along with the word marriage between a man and a woman or a desire to take away the the special meaning of that word for those who do believe that a union between a man and a woman is special and different than any other union while it may not be poc to say so i beleive i have seen a lot of spite in the homosexual community and a real desire to injure those in the heterosexual community rather than just be equal not all the homosexual community feels that way but i believe some of the more virilent protests like this boycott stems from hatred not a desire for equality while i believe becuase we live in a free country anyone should be able to form a bond with anyone of legal age and capacity to consent i believe i am expressing the real reason prop 8 ended up the way it has we have seen a lot of terms redefined in the past 30 years gay used to mean joyfully happy sex used to mean intercourse between a man and a woman now marriage which is on the edge of meaning something other than it has meant for pretty much all the history of the english language my question is who is the pr firm and theire is always a pr firm behind all major movements dont kid yourself making the decisions to make sure these terms are adopted instead of creating new terms and why are they doing it i believe completely in equal legal rights under the law however that doesnt mean i think a moslem should be able to be ba mitzvahd if they dont accept the tenants of what a ba mitzvah means and i really dont think people who dont accept the tenants of a ba mitzvah should have the right to redefine it does anyone else am i crazy or doesnt there seem to be a rather obvious intent to obfuscate the meaning of words regarding one behavior pattern rather than earn similar societal recognition and respect for a different behavior pattern not yet proved to have similar benefit to society hell homosexuality might turn out to be better for society  time will tell but why adopt the words of a different behavior pattern whether or not the behavior is chosen or inborn if you want to be judged on your behaviors success i think people didnt vote for prop 8 becuase they were bigoted i dont think most people in california and elsewhere are bigoted i believe most people voted for prop 8 becuase they didnt want to be discriminated against in their own conduct and their right to use the word marriage which is a word that has been the word for the special union between a man and a woman since the beginning of the english and if you dont think the union between a man and a woman isnt deferent than the union between a two men or two woman then youre either a bisexual or you are not being honest about being a homosexual so heres my suggestion if this is about rights propose my amendment above and ill bet it will pas pretty easily and anyone in a homosexual union will have all the rights they desire if you dont want propose that amendment then it isnt about rights and how about being more honest and telling us what the real agenda is,politics

dude we can go back and forth over this forever and still not see eye to eye i am not opposed to gay marriage nor do i have any homophobic dna whatsoever the point i was basically trying to make is that supporters of prop 8 while having every right to their beliefs are turning around and trying to shut down those with opposing beliefs im not saying what the mormons did was right just that they have every bit as much right to bankroll a fight against as the gay community does to bankroll a fight for the boycotting of a chain of hotels associated with mormens not only seems immature but uses the very same discriminatory tactics that your trying to fight against on a whole other trolling note would you support my right to marry a 10yr old boy or a goat or a lamppost society has historically viewed marriage as a union between man and woman many many straight people would not like that union dissolved why do their rights not matter as much as those who want samesex marriage,politics

marriage isnt a right its a religious institution recognized by the state nobody is saying gays cant be joined in civil unions prop 8 was just a vote to not confuse the term marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman maybe some people think marrying their cousin or sister is a right the line has to be drawn somewhere and thats all prop 8 was about,politics
you seem to be reading a lot into what i say i dont question your views on prop 8 while i dont assume youre a homophobe some of your language a bunch of gays would be taken that way by some so if youre on the defensive because others have called you that in the past you may consider adopting better ways of referring to classes of people heres the thing i dont see why you consider it just as right to bankroll a fight to take away rights as equal to bankrolling a fight to give equal rights further i dont see how its discrimantory  well immature discrimination were not going after them for their beliefs but for their actions if the ceo of mariott came out and said he would stop tithing to the church then i would agree that boycotting him just for being a mormon was ridiculous but as it stands 10 of every check you give to these buisnesses goes to fund an organization that blatantly wants to enforce its antiquated code of bigotry thats the key difference people want to send a message that this kind of behavior is not tolerated in modern society consider the bus strikes over forcing blacks to sit at the back of the bus in the south were people being immature and just trying to get back at whitey or were they using their wallets to stop fund and organization that supported bigotry i tend to view it as the latter this case is the same to me on your last point you are conflating several issues we have an existing class of people consenting adults who are allowed the marry all that decent people are asking is that we not have second class citizens as the courts ruled that denying same sex marriage created extending marriage to nonconsenting adults is an entirely different and unrelated problem further how does extending legal marriage to same sex marriage in anyway dissolve straight religious unions their churches are still free to discriminate and they dont have to gay marry society historically viewed the woman as the mans property when they were wed  should the rights of people who feel women should be property matter,politics

the forces of slavery havent been a controlling power for quite some time for most people of african ancestry thats not to say that slavery is dead within america just not a public institution as it was in the 160017001800s here one could say that the 13th amendment was a clear symbol others would suggest the 15th amendment was quite clear now the suggestion is that obamas election is that symbol i personally fail to see how the election of a man whose dad happens to be black who was raised by white folk and has no ancestral ties to slavery in the us vindicates slavery or provides a symbol that slavery is no longer a controlling power any more than the referenced amendments did had the ancestor of a slave been elected raised in a family that perhaps was oppressed through the early 20th century i could see some parallel but his story is much different than those who feel he represents them due to his skin tone,politics

i dont know much about this issue in the context of america but let me see the after effects of slavery lasted till as recently as the latter half of the 20th century in some form of apartheid black people were not treated as equals given the same jobs or educated in an equal manner all these were a direct result of slavery and the perceived resulting or related difference between a white man and a black man perceived to be inferior the black civil rights movement settled quite a bit of this with laws coming into place that prevented segregation and the like this was in the 1960s70s my own parents were born in 1958 i am twenty i think it is similar in america what this means is that i if i were black and the same age there would be part of the first generation thats lived completely in a world that treats me equally this can be an incredible effect i would like to see studies on the matter but i suspect that below a certain level of affluence test scores fall as parental income falls this is worth studying though there is a pretty clean line that can be drawn from slavery to apartheid to bad performance by blacks disclaimer i do not know much about public schooling in america if they have strict rules about having children below a certain schooled and for nutrition to be provided in india we have noon meal schemes the mid day meal is provided to students at school the disparity between rich and poor can be dramatically reduced provided both go to the same school,politics

legislate a lot of moral issues to a good many people like the taoists for instance is a personal matter and not something that should involve other people gthonestly how the fuck are we supposed to

moral or not if you are claiming that the conclusions you drew from your guidelines do not mean you were arguing that the actions were immoral then your theory cannot address morality and is thus flawed as a theory of morality gtat no point does the sentence say there needs to be a set of ideal preferences yes it does that is what a universal preference would be gtthe sentence merely states that each individual has a set of preferences which is undoubtedly true im afraid i dont follow this sentence are you saying that ill use the language of modal logic since it is more precise here a person has beliefs and that it is true they have beliefs a person has beliefs that are true all people have shared true beliefs gtwhen you call a car a car you are asserting that you prefer cars to be called car instead of donut so your flaw does not follow that isnt a good analogy i call a car a car because of my sociolinguistic background my old roommate called his suv a truck and i would not

stop making marriage a legal term when a couple is married the government should acknowledge it as being a civil union marriage is a religious thing and should stay that way but that shouldnt stop gays from gaining the same rights appropriated when bound in civil union that menwomen get when married this would solve the problem of the dilution of the institution of marriage while at the same time separating church and state as well as giving the gays the rights they wish to be granted nothing is really lost marriage keeps its sanctity without any real negatives the only realnoticeable difference would be that the governments definition of a man and a woman getting married will be reclassified as a civil union and that would be done solely for legal purposes no rights would be removed,politics

marriage is one of the oldest customs in human history why is it so ancient it solidifies in social terms the most significant union between two individuals the union of procreation and the subsequent guiding of a helpless newborn human born of this union through childhood to individualism marriage was a necessary development in human social evolution because it allowed conflicts leading to death rape infanticide and general social anarchy to be avoided simply because the social group agreed to recognize that the man and woman in question entered a union together that precluded others from entering this union with either of them this created the kind of social stability that ultimately allowed a group to flourish,politics

you are correct that it is not a good comparison but its clear to me that you vastly underestimate the pain parents can cause their gay children especially those with wacko religious beliefs obviously you have no knowledge of this so maybe you should get a pass on that i strongly support gay rights i also strongly support the rights of all people regardless of ethnic and racial heritage there are those in the right wing who would love to turn blacks against gays and vice versa nearly all gays just wont buy in to that one big reason the large number of gays who are black and every other shade of skin color also even though i believe the writer overstated the case there was this in his piece i should add that i dated a mormon man for a few months a while back what he told me about the lds churchs psychological warfare on their gay members the brutality and viciousness and intolerance with which they attack and hound and police the gay children of mormon families would make anyone shudder they hounded my ex for having hiv and for being gay they followed him secretly outed him to his family and persecuted him for his illness when he was diagnosed with hiv at brigham young he had to run out of the college clinic to escape those who wanted to sequester and punish him he died a few years ago most of his mormon family didnt show up for his funeral emphasis mine horrible treatment is horrible treatment no matter what the hateful reason is black arent required to feel any affinity for gay causes of course but you seem like one of those who would like to drive a wedge between blacks and gays if so that is a shame,politics

every single thing created by man is in some way linked down a chain to a natural resource you cant create something without manipulating a natural resource your definition of a resource is actually either a tool or a commodity its not a resource at all gtthen they understand wrong which is probably why they were nearly eradicated nah it was more the result of differential access to resources and technology at the root of it i think the main reason for the rise of civilization has been population pressure which was brought on of course by the movement of people to areas rich in natural resources when populations start to grow in more marginalized places they are stymied by the relative inaccessibility of food land or other environmental factors in contrast in places like mesopotamia for instance early civilization grew because peoples were able to intensify food production through both the fertile soil and new technologies like irrigation and had the space and resources to support so many people and as the population in the area grew there very quickly became a need for a more centralized government one who can act as a administrator to both food production and law additionally the rich agricultural land when combined with intensification strategies allowed surplus food surplus food and a centralized political authority meant that scholars and artisans and commodity producers like blacksmiths or pottery makers what would eventually become modern industry could be supported and encouraged because they no longer had to provide directly for themselves a centralized government also means that people can be mobilized for warfare on a large scale people like the native tribes that you speak of can then be eradicated in an effort to exploit and control natural resources or the trade of natural resources or commodities their ideologies the way they think then is probably more a product of the space in which they exist rather than some genetic predisposition to view the world in particular way when youre constrained by natural resources and maybe dont understand how certain processes work like why crops fail after exhausting the soil youre going to have a different relationship with them than if you can manipulate them relatively freely and easily or are far removed from them like you are,worldnews

those comments  that one guy i had to say this  ken salkover you are an idiot marriage is a civil right therefore the right to marry as a same sex couple is a civil right black people accounted for only 10 of the total vote you know what black people didnt do shit it was the other 90 white fundamentalist traditionalist christian denominations that did if marriage is indeed exclusive to a man and a woman then it must be abolished as it is discriminatory and oppressive the marriage institution that you favor due to the tradition of man and woman  also favors sexist relations between man and woman the ceremony itself is a sexist event  where one man hands over his property  the woman  to another man men and women as they are now do not compliment each other actually due to the systematic oppression of women they are dragged down together as divided we fall same sex couples do a wonderful job of showing what an equal relationship truly looks like and frankly i would rather marry a gay man than i would a woman purely for that reason however on that note i will not marry ever because of this traditionalist crap this sexist crap attached to it we do let old creeps marry teenaged girls  or almost need i bring up anna nicole smith or perhaps the many partners hugh heffner has had do you know what was mean spirited prop 8 what was the reason for prop 8 removing a civil right based on religious fundamentalist traditionalist malicious bigotry why else is it a civil right by not giving it to one group of people you dehumanise them you are not a human being enough to deserve this however those who are in a heterosexual relationship are you are saying that civil rights only apply to heterosexuals which is ridiculous need i remind you that throughout history samesex relationships and sexual practise were common ground and were considered a good thing it wasnt until recent religious dogma and state oppression that it turned otherwise and a civil union is not good enough giving a majority one thing and the minority another is a slap in the face and merely reiterates you are sub human again you are an idiot you also just tried to perpetrate racist slander so you are a racist bigot as well signed every oppressed group including homosexuals women racial minorities indigenous peoples ainu native americans aboriginal australians inuits etc the elderly the youth,politics
actually the reason there is such a hard fight for samesex couples to gain this civil right is because the marriage institution was designed to do two things  depending on what you lack at in its history the first was to create a family unit in order to keep the wealth of a family within the family  to further accumulate it later as it was then transferred to the lesser classes it was used to control and oppress the sexuality social status and personal ideology of the woman everything from the ceremony to the religious aspects to the societal results of marriage are proof of this the woman in most countries can give up her last name freely the man however cannot do so automatically rather has to go through other routes to change it to hers the ceremonies often consist of a transfer between father to husband of the woman or family to family of the woman showing that the woman belongs to them that she is their property until handed over to the new familyhusband it was designed  along with other parts of society in order to maintain the ideology  to perpetrate a womans dependancy on the man and then in turn give the man a sense of empowerment a sense of duty of status higher than that of the woman this ideology only came under scrutiny in this last century steadily its favor has been declining and frequent attacks against it by gay rights and womens rights groups are pushing it into a corner that is what marriage is about and that is why we need to legalise gay marriage in order to destroy the oppressive nature of it to back its built in bigotry into a corner and smash it,politics

marriage is and always has been between men and women that is the way the majority of people in ca want it to stay those who are married do not want to be in the same category as homosexual couples because that was not the nature of the institution that they subscribed to when they got married yes all americans should have equal rights and that includes homosexual couples they should have access to health insurance and other benefits and rights which it is my understanding they do if there is something they are not granted then that should be the issue not whether or not it is called marriage call it something else it is different than marriage between a man and a woman how one obvious difference is the manner in which sex is performed anal sex was never the intention of the design of the human body regardless of whether you believe in creationism or evolution this is a medical fact because there are bacteria in the colon along with stool feces and waste to be discarded that was never intended to be in contact with the skin of others that is why there is the risk of epididymoorchitis from anal sex and utis in women anal penetration can lead to relaxation of the anal sphincter and fecal incontinence in the long run just because there is a hole there does not mean something should go in it the vagina and the penis were made to complement each other a key in a hole effect women cannot have intercourse with women except by using some intermediary device there is no way you can equate that with the natural mechanism of intercourse that the human body was designed for men cant have babies with men and women cant have babies with women you might argue well not all women and not all men can have babies true there are always aberrations in physiology because of genetics not to speak of mans interventions that lead to infertility but the biological design is what it is if we were intended to express our bisexuality which some may argue exists then why werent be generally born with both sex organs only a very rare minority of people are and yes heterosexual couples have anal intercourse but that is out of experimentation and not by design and strictly for pleasure if homosexuality is across the board a phenomenon of nature then why is there a tendency to still have sexual polarity in homosexual relationships where one has the more feminine and the other the more masculine role in many cases if girls like girls in lesbian relationships then why does one of the girls tend to dress like a boy or exhibit more masculine behavior is that really intrinsic homosexuality if so why is the feminine partner attracted to a more masculine figure that says to me that there is still an attraction to the opposite persuasion however the effects are less dramatic or more tolerable when dealing with the same sex it is less intimidating or threatening i think that homosexuality is for the most part a negative reaction to the societal pressures on gender assimilation that starts at a very early age i think that the minority of homosexuals are physiologically homosexual where the body is programmed as such either from genetic or developmental anomalies this issue of gay marriage is not strictly one of religious beliefs especially with all africanamericans the argument that because people were liberal enough to vote for obama therefore they should vote for prop 8 is not a valid one i think obama is against same sex marriage but was advised to change his tune to appease the gay population in order to garnish more votes some people are trying to equate the ban on samesex marriage with historical prohibition against interracial marriage or other racial discriminations such as segregation if you cannot see the difference between interracial marriage and same sex marriage you are in complete denial they are clearly not the same dont try to ride on the backs of the protests against slavery and segregation to justify the equal rights premise for homosexuals to be married blacks were struggling for the recognition that they are equal in composition and capability as any other human being based upon being the same species as white people the embryological design is for men and women to have sex and procreate not men with men and women with women the institution of marriage which has been around for centuries has always been between a man and a woman homosexuality has also been around for centuries yet why wasnt marriage proposed between same sex couples eons ago because they knew it was not the natural order of things and would create confusion marriage goes back thousands of years and invokes other terminology such as husband and wife that only applies to marriage and no other situation when you have a same sex couple marry you have to change or modify the terminology which changes the institution how can one state decide to change it for all of those who have been married and change the meaning of what that represents many may have chosen not to marry if that was considered the umbrella of marriage and it is their right to preserve what they entered into when they did not have it modified after the fact marriage is not the same between samesex couples and should not be called the same thing this whole premise is one of sheer denial you cannot pretend to be other than what you are you can live that way but it does not change the reality if you are a woman and consider yourself a man well guess what you can still be afflicted with womens diseases even if you change the genital structures in the body the cell types are still those of a woman in the reproductive organs things may be suppressed with hormonal therapy but i dont think you can get testicular cancer for example if you are a woman genetically if same sex marriages are allowed then this is a precedent for anyone to do anything and it should have to be accepted like every other situation any lifestyle can be promoted as equal to another then what defines the society anything goes what is next polygamy sanctioned pedophilia incest people marrying their animals why not they may love each other too and want them to have equal rights equal rights can be obtained by all americans but that does not mean that the terminology should be the same especially because of the historical implications of this and the decision should not be made by a judge but by the people who have already spoken twice in ca i am not homophobic i have had homosexual friends some of whom i think did it for the cultural freedom and some who seemed to enjoy a private life of their choice but i do not think that you can change something that has been established for so long and would change the essence of an institution that dates back centuries and decide to change it because it fits an agenda that is based on false premises and if you are right about this you should be able to state your case without violence or vitriol that weakens your argument that this is based on justice when i say you i am not referring to you in particular but those who are doing so,politics

in the case of president bill clinton the death penalty rhetoric had a very clear goal to reclaim issue ownership from the republicans over this topic and he succeeded theres a very interesting paper hes stealing my issues clintons crime rhetoric and the dynamics of issue ownership1 which deals with this episode not only did clinton say he supported the death penalty but during the campaign he even supervised the execution of a functionally retarded person2 in arkansas  i know we cannot execute bush for treason anymore since the supreme court ruling of 20023 clinton then managed to change the dimension over which the parties discussed crime from a focus on punishment to one stressing prevention the media coverage of his policies for fighting crime was greater than those of the previous two republican presidents bush sr and reagan if clinton truly wholeheartedly did believe in the death penalty im not 100 sure from what i know of presidentelect barack obamas worldview it is difficult to accept that he supports it too my guess is that hes only being politically realistic since he wanted to be president in order to change things around i think his stupid remarks on samesex marriage i believe marriage is between a man and a woman i am not in favor of gay marriage4 fall under the same political pragmatism category 1 ýçùþêüåýãúêüùõøâóüêéèýòøâóâêâéðúúåâçóª 2 ýçùþøóüýàüõóéýöôàììüðæþöðçäæöìäàêéâ 3 ýçùþøóüýàüõóéýöôàììüðµéþîüøóëääîæüüóæ 4 ýçùþêüåüêùëóûéâóþôçéèýò ãôòïøâçûóùìæóèúåûêëôáäíèâßþæûú,worldnews
misleading headline if the law allows for execution then certainly an innocent person will be executed eventually we have to accept that punishing the innocent is an unavoidable result of having a legal system so we should ask how do we minimize that outcome without having the solution be worse than the problem deciding a case or making a law based on one emotional situation is like putting a hack into your code to solve an immediate problem it can cause trouble down the road i strongly hope that if the man in the article is innocent that he goes free but rationally i know it will be hard for that to happen without changing the system in a way that will make it harder to punish the guilty in the future edit from rediquetteýçùþêüåæúéùøâòíùáãàêøùüöãêèéø please dont downvote comments just because you disagree with them you should downvote comments that are uninformative or offtopic,worldnews

in theory the criminal justice system exists to serve three purposes  prevention of crime  rehabilitation of offenders  retribution the death penalty certainly does not rehabilitate criminals studies show citation needed i know but i dont have time to search right now that the existence of the death penalty does not prevent violent crime retribution is the only purpose served by the death penalty with a chance of executing an innocent man you never know if that retribution has been served on the right person further retribution is condemned in every other aspect of society like the old saying two wrongs dont make a right many religious conservatives cite the passage an eye for an eye as the justification for capital punishment however this passage is being misinterpreted in this debate the purpose of the passage was to limit excessive punishment not a call for exacting revenge for example if someone stabbed your eye the most you could do back to them was stab them in the eye this titfortat system of justice was condemned by jesus in the new testament everyone atheists alike knows the passage about turning the other cheek disclaimer i bring up the religious aspect because thats what justifies the death penalty for many supporters i myself am an atheist and find it morally wrong to execute other human beings for crimes especially when it cannot be determined with absolute certainty who the perpetrators are edit formatting,worldnews

chuckle okay so the argument is that youve got a new form a better form a more pure form of socialism thats been the mantra of every country sincebut hey okay well run with it let me point out the following  every country that has attempted to adopt socialist approaches has flopped without exception and despite a large number of people and a lot of time involved in the experiment  the people in those countries were not unaware of marx  in fact i dont want to attack you but i would wager that a number of them even had a better understanding of what he was talking about than you did if they could have magically made everything work by the simple expedient of breaking open one of his books its pretty safe to say that they would have done so arguing that many many millions of people lacked some insight into his work that you do isnt very convincing to me at any rate if your objection is that people must have abused the system for it to fail my point is that resistance to abuse is a fundamental characteristic that such a system must have to survive if we had no laws or punishment for murder for example its a good bet that people would start killing each other even if the ideal man would not do so its necessary to take into consideration human nature a society without a law against murder isnt a very appealing society even if in a world populated by ideal people it would be unnecessary capitalism has the aim of aligning ones own interest and the interest of the whole  to make more money one must produce a product that others want enough to choose to spend their own money on it to control resources one must have effectively used resources in the past the model does not perfectly model the real world people are not always perfectly informed or perfectly rational but it is accurate enough to have worked quite well historically certainly better than command economies gtbut thats not the definition of socialism its the definition that the world uses and its at least somewhat similar to what you were saying  that the original use wasnt accurate because it didnt require nationalization of industry but i dont really have any objection to you using the term differently as long as you dont expect me to do so its what the system actually entails that matters  arguing over definitions is fairly uninteresting if i see you claiming that socialism has some particular benefit ill probably disagree on the grounds that its quite misleading to use a nonstandard definition of course  someone sees what youre talking about and thinks that youre talking about what the world normally means when it says socialism and winds up rather misled  but byandlarge arguing over definitions isnt terribly interesting,politics
ive talked about and discussed these problems with you and last time you labeled me as an evil person that wishes to classify a broad group of people as subhuman vermin i maintain that my position has nothing to do with religion except in the basis of our culture the extent of religious influence in this way is debatable you have said that me and people like me want to treat gays as subhuman vermin this is not true reading your comments im not sure you can see it any other way but i wish to talk to again in case you are right if you think that i am against gay marriage i am the reasons for this are different than what you and others have assumed the phrase same sex marriage is an oxymoronic statement in the first place marriage is an institution and has value and status in our society marriage is the description we give in our culture to a man and women committed to each other and committed to the attempt at raising offspring which results in family the family is created from this union and the offspring created from it family is an important foundation of the society and culture in which we live same sex couples can not do this couples of opposite sex can regardless of their race or religious views produce offspring and start families this is the basis of my stance against same sex marriage most if not all of these important issues are separate from the institution of marriage there are claims to rights that you might make but many of these arent rights anyway and the word shouldnt be used so loosely these perks such as tax deductions and employer benefits for example are given to married couples who reproduce offspring they are benefits and encouragements to produce offspring and create family producing offspring and starting families is a benefit to our culture and society same sex couples offer little or no competition to the institution of marriage in this way why should same sex couples be rewarded as if they benefit society the same way you have spoken in the past of dissenting views and the culmination of those views being equal to the desire to strip others of their rights i for myself claim no desire to strip others of their rights many of the rights you claim that i have a desire to strip arent even rights and shouldnt be related to the argument of prop8 anyway other rights you claim shouldnt be exclusive to married couples though if gay couples who have shared their lives together and love each other want to be protected by law why shouldnt they have some protection shouldnt they be allowed to visit each other in hospital in times of sickness i see no reason to object and would argue in favor of this should we really try to answer all of the problems related to this in one yes or no answer,politics

again the point is not that the girl was not a virgin but that she lied about something important to her husband to be she admitted that if she had told the truth he would not have married her you can replace virginity by _whatever_ if property z is important for x and y marries x lying about z i dont understand how y could claim that an annulment is unfair now it seems that the true debate is purely technical around the difference between annulment and divorce which are two different things the latter requiring virginity to be an essential property of the person i could not find examples of what are usually considered as essential properties for the french law i guess it has to be related to health but the single example was a 19th century trial where a woman learnt her husband was a former convict,worldnews

first of all let me say that i do not think any kid should shout assassinate anyone that being said im not sure that your argument is valid to hate obamas presidential position in spite of him not even being there yet is to hate the man himself perhaps people and obviously these children have taken it too far do not agree with what obama says he will do once in office i think its fair to say you can hate policy without hating the man,politics

a minor correction before we go any further if you voted for or supported prop 8 i label you as a person who has undertaken an evil action not as an evil person i think the difference is rather important  your central claims appear to be 1 marriage is if not entirely at least mostly about procreation 2 homosexuals cannot reproduce which leads naturally to the conclusion marriage should be restricted to heterosexuals i think both of your central claims are manifestly false and i really do wonder if you have thought them through id like to address the claim about homosexuals and reproduction first while it is inarguable that reproduction at our current level of technology anyway requires a woman with a working uterus that hardly excludes homosexuals lesbian couples are perfectly capable of reproduction yes they do require outside help in the form of donated sperm but thats hardly a major problem theres the turkey baster and sperm donated by a male friend method for lesbians looking to do things locally and inexpensively other couples such as mary cheney and heather poe used more expensive services obviously a pair of men lack the necessary uterus but this hardly prevents gay couples from raising children sex advice columnist dan savage wrote a book the kid about the experience he and his partner had in adopting and raising a child other than adoption of genetically random children other possibilities abound i read about a gay couple who had a child when one of the mens sister donated both her uterus and one of her eggs to the cause i personally know two same sex couples one male the other female who cooperated to reproduce the men donated the sperm the women the eggs and uteri nine months later the men adopted one of the children the women kept the other and everyone was happy the point is that lesbian couples can quite easily procreate and that gay male couples can raise children while i do not wish to belittle the hardship of pregnancy i do think that in the modern era it is the raising of a child that is the more important part so even if we accept your first claim that marriage is about procreation then lesbian couples should hardly be excluded from marriage yes but your first claim is even more wrong and self evidently false than your second the mere existence of childless married couples soundly refutes the claim that the institution exists solely to offer advantages for those who chose to breed unless you believe that sterile people should be banned from marriage and that married couples who do not produce children within a few years should have their marriages annulled etc we can see that you yourself dont believe that marriage is all about procreation the idea that people marry because after thinking something along the lines of hmmm this person has many positive genetic traits and is fertile we should procreate but id like some legal protections and tax breaks too so ill propose marriage is patently ridiculous people never talk about marriage in exclusively or even primarily reproductive terms unless theyre arguing against same sex marriage outside of this context all discussion of marriage is about commitment love and devotion this leads me to strongly suspect that people are lying perhaps even to themselves when they suddenly start talking about marriage exclusively in terms reproduction when they argue against same sex marriage gtthese perks such as tax deductions and employer benefits for example are given to married couples who reproduce offspring first you are incorrect employer benefits apply to childless straight couples as well as those who have children second what of gay couples who have children you seem oddly convinced that gay  childless and that is simply not true committed gay couples tend to have children at about the same rate as committed straight couples gtif gay couples who have shared their lives together and love each other want to be protected by law why shouldnt they have some protection shouldnt they be allowed to visit each other in hospital in times of sickness i see no reason to object and would argue in favor of this then you should be supporting gay marriage in hospitals it is extremely common for visitors to critical patients to be limited to family only and homophobic hospital staff sometimes take a sadistic joy in applying that rule quite strictly there are several instances on record of gay couples in states with domestic partnership laws being denied visitation on the grounds that they arent family that they arent married in addition to hostile hospital staff there is also the issue of hostile inlaws vastly more common than visitation denied by sadistic hospital employees is the genetic family of the dying partner blocking visitation since thanks to the efforts of you and people like you the couple cant be legally married the vindictive genetic family of a gay person in a coma can quite lawfully prohibit his partner from visiting from attending the funeral etc worse in many states the constitutional amendments passed explicitly forbade any legal recognition of agreements that closely approximated marriage which means that even if a gay couple took the time and money to have a lawyer draw up a power of attorney even if the partner who wants to visit has by some stroke of fortune the legal documents in his possession those amendments nullify such documents and thats not even mentioning the issue of prison visitation insurance coverage etc not too long back a gay man on the daily kos posted an account of his marriage in florida he married a lesbian woman and his partner married her partner they didnt really know each other they dont live together and they rarely speak to their spouses why insurance he had a job that offered insurance to a wife the woman his partner married had a job that offered insurance to her husband thanks to you and people like you they were forced to make a mockery of marriage by marrying people they didnt love in fact people they hardly knew simply to get health insurance for their loved ones he says that all four of them cried during the brief ceremony at the courthouse not from joy but from outrage and misery at the fact that they could not marry the people they loved when people take actions that cause that sort of undeserved anguish i call that evil the question remains why do you think it isnt evil to cause such pain and suffering to gay people,politics

i agree that charging pimps in these cases with rape makes sense but i think you may be letting johns off too easily consider the situation youre deciding whether or not to have sex with a particular woman for money you know a decent percentage of prostitutes are victims of trafficking but you arent sure if this woman is thus you dont know whether youd be having consensual sex with a prostitute or be taking advantage of a sex slave is it really defensible to risk effectively raping a woman im not sure charging johns with rape is the right thing to do in these situations however i think that someone patronizing a prostitute has the moral responsibility to make sure the woman isnt enslaved,worldnews
gt im not sure charging johns with rape is the right thing to do in these situations however i think that someone patronizing a prostitute has the moral responsibility to make sure the woman isnt enslaved i agree 100 the problem is the law isnt enforceable the only scenarios where someone is going to get caught are  the girl escapes and goes to police and the girl can identify the client  the client gets caught in the act both scenarios should expose the pimp who should be charged with every count of rape and the client should receive a charge depending on the circumstance not a catchall rape charge,worldnews
gt this doesnt make much sense to me to prosecute a man under this law you would need to know the woman was trafficked exactly so the new law prevents johns from reporting trafficked women a few years ago i was staying at a hostel in bucharest and the guy that ran the place took some of the boys out for a sleezy night at the seediest of local brothels one of the lads ended up with a girl who was visibly upset and ended up crying and begging him to rescue her she was very clearly a victim of trafficking as a tourist to bucharest at that time id have no idea if this could be safely reported to the police but right now  were i in a similar situation in the uk  i could do so safe in the knowledge that the plod could raid the place amp the girls would get some help putting their lives back together this new law prevents the punter from doing so because in this case the only way he can help the victims is to criminalise himself as an aside i should add that my nextdoor neighbour is a pro she drives down from a town about an hour away on the motorway and works two days a week she has two kids has a nice car and reports that she couldnt find any other job that pays so well and enables her to look after her kids another girl from the same town uses the flat another two days a week im pretty sure that name withheld would love some other job that paid as well and allowed her to spend as much time with her kids  from my one conversation with her on the subject i dont get the impression that shes living every guys fantasy of the slutty girl whos a hooker because she likes sex cf belle de jourýçùþõêúñùùøïýúæèðçàäúøþôèöôû  but things being as they are i dont see why she should be prevented from undertaking consensual relations with anyone,worldnews

the probability of a male catching hiv regardless of circumcision during vaginal intercourse is already very very low women are at greater risk as are people having anal sex the reasons seem to be due to tearing of skin and blood transmission both of which are more likely in the case of anal sex or being a woman so lets assume that if youre out sowing your seeds youll use a condom either way since no none wants dick warts etc if you look at this from a risk management perspective the control used to manage the risk should be appropriate for example im not going to build a moat around my house to prevent pirates from invading it the cost of the moat is not justified by the risk similarly i think using circumcision to minutely reduce the probability of catching hiv is inappropriately heavy handed especially since its pretty unlikely the baby will have sex prior to being able to decide to be circumcised,worldnews

i know people who claim to believe that abortion is murder the problem is that they either have to be lying possibly even to themselves or they have to be some of the most abominable cowards who have ever walked the face of the earth if i believed really honestly no fooling believed that abortion were identical to murdering a baby i wouldnt be harassing women at a clinic id be shooting doctors and bombing clinics id devote every resource i had my life fortune and sacred honor to the cause but they ask me to think that they really do believe abortion is exactly the same as killing babies and that they essentially do nothing that they may if they arent too tired go to a clinic and shout vile epithets at scared young women for an hour or two im forced to conclude that theyre either liars or cowards of the most pathetic variety i think it is more reasonable to conclude that however much they may lie about it possibly even to themselves that deep down they know perfectly well that abortion isnt murder now the question of where to draw the line is an interesting and necessary question i think roe did a good job abortion is legal and relatively unrestricted in the first trimester 1 restricted but available in the second trimester and forbidden except to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman during the third trimester 2 i think the roe scale of gradated abortion availability is a very good way of dealing with the question of when a fetus becomes human despite the lunatic ravings of antiabortion nutters women dont randomly decide to abort in their 8th month such abortions only take place when a the fetus is sufficiently malformed that it wont live outside the uterus 3 or b continued pregnancy would threaten the life or health of the woman my point is simply that the whole prolife movement is based on lies or monstrous cowardice they dont even believe their own rhetoric so why should we waste our time paying them the slightest bit of attention those of us who dont have actual visible bats flying out of our ears can productively discuss when humanness begins all they can do is distract and annoy they have nothing of value to contribute to the discussion 1 the overwhelming majority of abortions take place in this time when the fetus has a brain that is roughly equivalent to a garden lizard 2 note this is why all the laws prohibiting partial birth abortions are bullshit abortion in the third trimester is already prohibited by roe except to protect life or health the partial birth laws are nothing but a disguised attempt to get a foot in the door and circumvent roe entirely 3 note that recently in ireland evil antiabortion fanatics tried to legally compel a 16 year old to carry to term a baby that had no brain they felt it was extremely important to force her to carry a corpse in her body and expel it from her vagina the only conclusion that can be drawn is that they must have either hated her personally or hated women,worldnews

male foreskin performs a number of functions first it directly enhances sexual pleasure via specialized erogenous nerve endings such as the frenulum the ridged band and stretch receptors called meissners corpuscles the foreskin also serves to protect the moist mucous membrane of the glans the head of the penis and the inner foreskin from outside elements similar to the way the female foreskin protects the clitoris when the foreskin is removed the penis is transformed from an internal organ into an external one initiating a desensitizing process known as keratinization keratin is a tough skinlike substance similar to a callus that forms on top of the nerve endings of the glans resulting in significant loss of sexual sensitivity the foreskin also provides a gliding mechanism during sexual intercourse that reduces friction and locks in moisture acting as a natural lubricant the foreskin provides a number of other important functions as well gt no ones complained to me yet at least do colorblind people know to complain they only recognize their deficiency when they come across people who can enjoy more colorsand the earlier the circumcision the greater the loss of

circumicision was less damaging than it could have been gt why cant men be convinced of the facts otakucode the people who say those things are people who do not have the ability to regard their personal experience as anything but the universal unfettered truth they know that they have some sexual pleasure so they conclude that guys with intact foreskins must not be able to have any more they

youthof course i have never seen a difference in my quality of life without the foreskin cause it is all i know gt show me proof of these things hopeless_case i have also noticed that in circumcision debates any attempt to claim that uncircumcised men enjoy a fuller sexual experience are met with the challenge to prove that that is true when it is pointed out that the foreskin is endowed with a much higher density of specialized nerve endings not found in normal skin the response then becomes prove that those nerve endings actually contribute to a fuller sexual experience i have thought of the following reply i believe it is well known that a significant fraction of uncircumcised men enjoy the manipulation of their foreskin by their partners by circumcising an infant you are denying the adult they will mature into a category of stimulation that a significant number of men find arousing and enjoyable that a significant number of men even a majority might not find that category of experience interesting or even ever discover it during their sex lives still gives no one the right to deny a man the right to decide for themselves as adults which types of sexual experience they will value gt what are you trying to persecute jews and muslims no the goal is to protect children from needless elective surgery that removes useful tissue in particular islam doesnt require

your idea is intuitively appealing but i can admit that part of what motivates my desire to see obese people pay more is the fact that their body mass is mostly due to their own excesses theres a bit of moralizing to it and i see the benefits of providing further incentive for the obese to reduce their size there are people however who have no control over their body size  im thinking not really of the obese but the generally massive one of my coworkers is 69 and has a broad but relatively trim build i have no idea how much he weighs but im sure its both a lot and healthy for his size i wouldnt feel comfortable charging him more than a 54 220 lb woman  im sure he spends a fortune on clothes already i guess there are two other issues here 1 the number of men the size of my coworker is very small and 2 this debate is about mass and the carrying capacity of aircraft but also about sheer girth some of these people simply spill over into other seats weight is a good proxy for this problem but not necessarily a perfect one,worldnews

lets be realistic its a 24 hour news cycle with elections every 2 years the elections are never over if we stay focused we can win more seats in 2010 which is closer than most of you realize in 2010 obama may have his administrations greatest election challenge because that will line up with his time line to pull out of iraq so the gop will be spinning the white flag of surrender lines and all this crap in 2010 trying to pick up congressional seats i think one of the key weaknesses of the dems is that they dont stay focused on winning once they win look at bill clinton we rallied to put him in office on a rather big victory of 6 points and 370 electoral votes then in 2 years we did nothing and congress went to the gop in 1995 and its had been in their hands since 2006 when the dems won the house and tied the senate now we have a slight lead in the senate after all these years and you want to back down  i want to stomp the gop for 13 years like they did the dems no matter what we do republicans will be idiots so its up to the dems to push through as much legislation as possible while they have the full majority if we had won 23 more seats wed have a super majority and obama could just wave his hand and pass legislation p as it stands 2010 will be an easy election to spin against the dems well still be in economic trouble and it could be much worse and well have iraq to deal with all over again the dems needs to position themselves now to win in 2010 and that includes the dem supporters simply not letting up the house should be in constant investigation of shady gop dealings the people should be in constant skepticism that they can be trusted and the dem leaders should continue their voter drive efforts the 50 state election plan should just stay in effect all the time nothing is worth letting our guard down and putting another bush or mccain or even reagan into office these people will all put us deep into debt with their nonmath based fiscal strategies basically they take their ego and they fund it with tax dollars and the middle class pays the price why should we really let up because its not longer entertaining to you  see thats exactly the mindset that loses the dems elections big time every couple cycles the gop will fight tooth and nail every cycle and the dems will sit back with the  oh well let the best man win attitude that just doesnt work and the last 30 years are proof why should we let palin out of the news cycle  she is a point of embarrassment to the gop they really ran this woman on a natural security platform with a 72 year old president this is ammo for decades against the gop if we just hold these key issues like torture spying total debt economics and the favoritism and constant lack of quality in their appointments if we stop talking about it you might not believe it but people really will forget i think its safe to say hilary might have lost the election because of the bad rep the gop pinned on the clintons after bills affair sure it was nothing really but the gop rode it out for everything claiming constitutional righteousness they said this isnt about politics its about doing whats right the president lied to the people  about a blow job and wasnt actually found to have lied but it sells in the press and it has hurt the dems greatest modern legacy bill clinton who to date has the most impressive economic stats in modern history the really impressive part is that with all that added revenue bill did not expand federal government in all directions like reagan and bush did with their economic booms and all three ended up with recessions or worse at the end of their terms but clintons was by far the least and by far not caused by the government but rather the com burst reagan and bushs tactics directly caused the recessions that followed their terms spend spend spend we should keep the debt stats in the peoples mind we should keep blaming the gop for 40 years of bad economics we should keep showing the nation how the gop works with big business to kill clean and efficient technology because waste and consumption makes them more money the elections are never over in a place like america perhaps the press is much to blame but it is the way it is the dnc should have voter drives every year many dems would still give money to secure their majority but they need obama to rally behind the idea that voter drives dont need to stop and the dems have the largest untapped voter pool because as they say life has a liberal bias this landslide victory is not a lot different than bill clintons and we lost congress right after he won office so maybe you need to read up more or the political history of your time before you let entertainment value guide your choices in propaganda i admit its not a nice game to play but do you want another bush another administration of entirely unqualified people who are all yes men happy to break the law because they know theyll get a pardon  id rather just play dirty and bombard the gop with the truth about their platform election cycle or not until we have 30 years of mostly dem rule we are still losing obama should be out there hand selecting the 2010 candidates of his choice trying to pick the weakest gop seats and win them with quality people and the obama bump the real point of power is if obama rallies the public when the gop tries to filibuster all his big plans they still have the power to unify and stop national health care in the senate along with energy policies if they dont stop it they will just corrupt it with pork spending and bullshit loopholes just hoping to sabotage the dems legislation even if it means the nation loses billions the gop could care less because they want power at any

well not all uncut ones are attached to handsome europeans speaking from experience there are some notsohandsome europeans with rather nice penises err anyway of course penises dont actually matter in my decisions about who i run around with being that i generally have to make my judgement about a man long before i see his member in any event not really sure where i stand on how effective education would be trying to educate away an ingrained public perception is never easy i would say legislation for most things is a last resort murder is bad but we still have laws against it because it still happens but it may come to that if large numbers of people honestly feel violated by the practice we cant really wait for education to step in where legislation would be instant but perhaps medical professionals should make it clear to parents what their options are in regards to circumsizing or not circumsizing their child one guy told me his parents had him circumsized so he wouldnt get made fun of by his circumsized friends in the locker room the whole thing is just odd,worldnews

carol kirkman and margaret gonzalez a couple from lawndale calif planned to get married saturday they werent worried about proposition 8 passing a ballot measure to ban samesex marriage in california kirkman told the los angeles times we didnt even think twice that this would pass she said they had been planning the wedding for two months with confidence in our neighbors and family members that this would never pass but instead of celebrating kirkman and gonzalez spent the day protesting the passage of prop 8 in downtown los angeles the law passed with just 52 percent of the vote how did this ban happen especially in a blue state protect marriage was the main organization behind the ban it served as an intermediary between the various groups that worked to pass the measure the mormon church was one of the groups that played a pivotal role with financial institutional and volunteer support protect marriage estimates that mormons contributed as much as half of the nearly 40 million raised in support of the measure according to the new york times californians against hate a nonprofit organization working to publicize the names of contributors to prop 8 filed a complaint thursday with californias fair political practices commission alleging that the church did not report nonmonetary contributions in support of the measure jeff flint a strategist with protect marriage estimates that mormons made up at least 80 percent of the early volunteers who went doortodoor according to the new york times the church is currently taxexempt under section 501c3 of the internal revenue code this status requires an organization to not be an action organization or a group that attempts to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities according to the irs tax guide for churches and religious organizations publication 1828 the irs decides what constitutes substantial according to publication 1828 they look at various factors including time devoted and expenditures to determine the extent of the churchs efforts they only need to read the last paragraph of the fourparagraph call to action that the mormon first presidency instructed leaders to read to congregations on june 29th they read we ask that you do all you can to support the proposed constitutional amendment by donating of your means and time to assure that marriage in california is legally defined as being between a man and a woman our best efforts are required to preserve the sacred institution of marriage the full letter is available in the newsroom at áøôæü first presidency members are described on the web site as special witnesses of jesus christ the first presidency is headed by the prophet who mormons believe receives revelation from god mormons were persuaded to support prop 8 because they believed god expected it when the prophet asks they tend to listen the church didnt devote just substantial effort it fully dedicated the church to the effort the church prophet thomas monson made a mistake by allowing it to believe action was required a request from the prophet surpasses substantial it was the single biggest most effective move the church could have made monson wasnt trying to save the sacred institution of marriage mormons think that civil marriage is an earthly contract and celestial marriage performed in a church temple and is a sacred covenant according to an article in the church magazine ensign temple marriages were not being threatened so his move was not religious it was political as a result the mormon church should be stripped of its taxexempt status many mormons have already decided to leave the church because of its involvement in prop 8 at èüìüîâüùôàøãâøùöîâüôàì an individual shares her story she said i gave it my very best effort and sadly nearly killed myself because of what i was taught i almost believed that dath was better than acknowledging my samesex attraction or shaming my family or my deceased mother i really believed that my mother would be ashamed of me into eternity sadly that was taught to me by the priesthood leaders of the church the priesthood or authority granted to male members in the church makes leaders influential they should have used this influence wisely,politics

gtnoone except you is saying its worth it yep its just me the whole idea came from me one guy on reddit the history of the gold standard speaks for itself and i dont feel the need to defend it gtbecause of whats gone on over the last 100 years or so gti keep hearing this and noone bothers to explain the problem i usually get pointed to some lame youtube video how about you fill me in using your own words i hope you like reading a lot more than watching videos here we go after the enactment of the federal reserve act and the establishment of the irs both in 1913 those organizations started to bleed the american people of their money the federal reserve did it through the manipulation of inflation and their ability to lend endless money to the government the irs did it through control of the tax code and its interpretation the federal reserve and the government figured out a way to create money out of nothing for the government to use while foisting the actual cost of the money on to the people via taxes controlled by the irs it used to be that when the federal government wanted to spend more money than they took in in taxes they had to borrow money either from wealthy citizens or other governments they would borrow money with interest and they eventually had to pay back that money after the creation of the federal reserve things no longer worked that way if the government wanted to borrow read spend more money than what they took in in taxes plus what the people with money and the other governments wanted to lend them they could just go to the federal reserve who had agreed to lend them whatever amount they need to cover the difference however the federal reserve does not actually have the money it lends to the government they simply print the money and add it to the governments balance sheet this money is backed by nothing but you guessed it the full faith and credit of the us government so the federal reserve is creating money and lending it to the institution that is backing the money and what is backing that institution the us tax payer the money is then injected back in to the us economy and in turn the us banking system who in turn lend it out at interest even though the initial money came from nothing but a balance adjustment made in a computer this concentrated the economic power among the elites as all of a sudden limitless money was always available and the banks were always the ones who handled that money and lent it out with the economic power concentrated the political power also became concentrated because the powerful lend to politicians and have smartly come to control advertising which now basically controls who is elected at almost every level of government add to this a military industrial complex backed by our tax dollars that is completely out of control thanks to the cold war and how those put in power by the rich dealt with it the deaths by assassination no less of two powerful politicians who looked like they might be going antifederal reserve jfk and rfk the rise of neoconservativism and its love of the ultrarich and the constant us military intervention abroad whose cost is ultimately shouldered by the tax payers while financed by money created out of nothing and profited off of by the bankers and yeah i dont like whats gone on over the last 100 years when it comes to our financial and tax system gtsystems that lasted a lot longer than any backed by fiat money gtand yet most of those have either collapsed or got off the gold standard how far are you looking back man gold has backed empires gtsee gold has a lot more uses than just being a currency backer thats why the demand is so high thats also why the gold standard works because there is always a demand for gold so the money is generally strong gtjacking up the price by almost 20x would probably have a more detrimental effect on the economy than it would be than having a currency backed by a shiny metal i think i got your point here but like i said before were going to be fucked to fix the system will take some serious balls from some politicians and a few years of biting the bullet for americans gtwhich in reality is no more worthwhile than the full faith and credit of the us government both have intrinsic value and both vary hey man can i pay for this in gold hey man can i pay for this with some fully backed credit notes i know what id prefer while you can say that the notes are worth just as much as the gold tell me if you think that people who just lost huge money in the markets think back and wish that they would have invested in gold instead of what looked like easy money futures ok now you go,politics

risk of sexual dysfunction it is without doubt that circumcision increases the risk of psychological sexual dysfunction a man who is unhappy with his foreskin can elect to undergo a circumcision a man who was forcefully circumcised as a child has no physical recourse physically the foreskin doesnt just provide more sensitivityit provides enhanced sensitivity the foreskin provides the brain with more information giving the man better control reducing premature ejaculation and a more satisfying sexual experience moreover there are more opportunities for sexual play when a foreskin is present many circumcised men have no mobile shaft skin to remove the foreskin is to rob a man of a significant portion of his sexual experience and it changes the very mechanics of sex because skin is no

foreskin from âúòðîàáôàìhttpâúòðîàáôàìfaqhtm the male foreskin performs a number of functions first it directly enhances sexual pleasure via specialized erogenous nerve endings such as the frenulum the ridged band and stretch receptors called meissners corpuscles the foreskin also serves to protect the moist mucous membrane of the glans the head of the penis and the inner foreskin from outside elements similar to the way the female foreskin protects the clitoris when the foreskin is removed the penis is transformed from an internal organ into an external one initiating a desensitizing process known as keratinization keratin is a tough skinlike substance similar to a callus that forms on top of the nerve endings of the glans resulting in significant loss of sexual sensitivity the foreskin also provides a gliding mechanism during sexual intercourse that reduces friction and locks in moisture acting as a natural lubricant the foreskin provides a number of other important

the event hess piloted a messerschmitt 110 into scotland in 1941 and was imprisoned there until the end of the war and was thereafter kept incommunicado in spandau prison in berlin until his death in

the silent majority author unknown a man whose family was jewish german aristocracy prior to world war two owned a number of large industries and estates when asked how many german people were true nazis the answer he gave can guide our attitude toward fanaticism very few people were true nazis he said but many enjoyed the return of german pride and many more were too busy to care i was one of those who just thought the nazis were a bunch of fools so the majority just sat back and let it all happen then before we knew it they owned us and we had lost control and the end of the world had come my family lost everything i ended up in a concentration camp and the allies destroyed my factories we are told again and again by experts and talking heads that islam is the religion of peace and that the vast majority of muslims just want to live in peace although this unqualified assertion may be true it is entirely irrelevant it is meaningless fluff meant to make us feel better and meant to somehow diminish the spectre of fanatics rampaging across the globe in the name of islam the fact is that the fanatics rule islam at this moment in history it is the fanatics who march it is the fanatics who wage any one of 50 shooting wars worldwide it is the fanatics who systematically slaughter christian or tribal groups throughout africa and are gradually taking over the entire continent in an islamic wave it is the fanatics who bomb behead murder or honour kill it is the fanatics who take over mosque after mosque it is the fanatics who zealously spread the stoning and hanging of rape victims and homosexuals the hard quantifiable fact is that the peaceful majority the silent majority is cowed and extraneous communist russia comprised russians who just wanted to live in peace yet the russian communists were responsible for the murder of about 20 million people the peaceful majority were irrelevant chinas huge population it was peaceful as well but chinese communists managed to kill a staggering 70 million people the average japanese individual prior to world war 2 was not a warmongering sadist yet japan murdered and slaughtered its way across south east asia in an orgy of killing that included the systematic murder of 12 million chinese civilians most killed by swordshovel and bayonet and who can forget rwanda  which collapsed into butchery could it not be said that the majority of rwandans were peaceful amp loving history lessons are often incredibly simple and blunt yet for all our powers of reason we often miss the most basic and uncomplicated of points peaceloving muslims have been made irrelevant by their silence peaceloving muslims will become our enemy if they dont speak up because like my friend from germany  they will awake one day and find that the fanatics own them and the end of their world will have begun peaceloving germans japanese chinese russians rwandans serbs afghans iraqis palestinians somalis nigerians algerians and many others have died because the peaceful majority did not speak up until it was too late as for us who watch it all unfold we must pay attention to the only group that counts the fanatics who threaten our way of life,worldnews

thats simply where i think the separation between the loose definition of terrorism and the strict definition lies i consider terrorists to be deliberate in their actions by that i mean i do not believe you can commit a crime with reckless negligence and in the commission of that crime accidentally be a terrorist for me mcveigh fails the test to be a terrorist by a strict definition for two reasons 1 he did not target civilians or civilian property even if he had a callous disregard for civilian life and property 2 he did not intentionally use violence and the threat of violence to further a political agenda even if he coincidentally had stronglyheld political beliefs revenge attacks on government infrastructure are not the type of thing i would generally consider terrorism the problem with the okc bombing is that it looks so much like terrorism that its very difficult for people to consider it anything but a similar example would be a black man hanged in the south people would have a difficult time considering it anything but a hate crime even if it turned out that he was killed by his wife for cheating and the reason she hanged him was to shame him people would still probably look at it as a hate crime simply because it looks like one although in all fairness the definition of a hate crime hasnt changed much whereas the definition of terrorism has terrorism is considered by many now to be any large public act of violence not committed by a recognized military force i guess what im trying to do is take the definition back,politics

here is valid criticism and the reason youve probably never heard it is because so few people have studied or considered military or wartime ethics even in an unjust war deaths of soldiers fighting for either side do not become mass murder if you argue that all war is murder and all deaths are always wrong then you and i can have a different argument but it appears that youre more aiming for the line that this war is an unjust war and thus the american soldiers are all murderers or aiding and abetting murder i am not considering the actual unjustified killing of noncombat civilians or soldiers not in conflict with the americans because any court of law would argue that that is still murder i am speaking of the killing of enemy soldiers combatantsnonunformed fightersirregularsetc who are in conflict with american soldiers and fighting back those are not murders the reason they are not murder is because when men take up arms in defense of their homelands they realize that they may kill or be killed and are purposefully choosing to risk their lives in such an endeavor beyond the general pervue of a man who simply picks up a handgun when he hears a person enter his home also at what point do you argue the war was unjust if there had been significant calls from iraqi nationals asking the us to invade and help them overthrow saddams dictatorship would the war have been justified are the real motivations of the invading countrys leaders the basis for why a war is just or unjust or is it something more stringent and based on the conditions of the country being invaded btw i am not claiming that i personally agree with this argument so we can avoid potentially inflammatory rhetoric of the ad hominem variety some might call it playing devils advocate but many consider that an admission that the arguer doesnt agree with what theyre arguing i am stepping back from that and saying im not going to tell you what i really think,politics

the issue here is is a person who is believed to be guilty not entitled to a fair trial the reason the lawyer gets angry is how the indian media treat things every day they step over the line and declare people guilty or not guilty it is the court that has to decide it even i believe that the the person the lawyer is defending is guilty but i still believe that he has a right to a fair trial the reason why that lady is acting like a stupid woman is that the lawyer ram jethmalani is a very senior and top lawyer in india had the cients lawyer been some low profile lawyer the channel and the lady wouldnt have given a shit about it,worldnews

every persons downfall is another persons gain that doesnt mean its some planned crash ill have to call gt retarded lt on this one go back to the libertarian sub you zombie think about what you are saying its not a real argument its bullshit zero evidence opinionated crap sure and maybe bush started the war in georgia to win the election for mccain and maybe we didnt really go to the moon and maybe nicolas cage is out decoding secrets of the masonic order right now i just doubt it but every fall will be an opportunity for someone sadly in an unregulated capitalist system that someone will tend to be fewer and fewer people whom have consolidated the wealth of the nation so even when we all go down they are still positioned to benefit the most if it takes money to make money it only stands to reason that no matter what the times its always best to have lots of money and in my mind that translates to an always on advantage for the rich that scales upward with their wealth giving them market advantage every time the only way to compete is to have a product vastly superior or else you cant even break into the market in any meaningful way before your competition reverse engineers your product we have lots of opportunity sitting around but lets face it it really is locked behind corporate profits i agree the wealthy control us from their armchairs but the wealthy are also at odds with each other their governments the people and the markets themselves its not a conspiracy its chaos revolving around money and when it goes bad the results are unpredictable and confusing for everyone however some companies make out better than other and some actually profit buying low and waiting for assets to appreciate its kind of like a self healing system that periodically cuts off its own finger just to remind itself why it needs to not cut off its fingers things get too bloated and then something like this shakes up the market rearranges some money puts new leadership in place and scares the public into paying attention its nothing all that amazing if you ask me i saw corporate america inflating itself since i can remember the whole yuppie boom and corporate wealth has been a bragging rite in some circles since the 80s at least this is why you cant give the rich tax breaks because it not how they spend it or where it trickles to its that if you arent rich theyll put you out of businesses with their tax breaks its not a model for open market competition its a market where one business model rules all and small business is at a constant disadvantage as they pay more of their income in taxes leaving them with less to improve their businesses or otherwise compete with the higher income competitions using corporate and franchise models to pool wealth and put the little guy out ok we cant stop a lot of that its a free using nasty business models as it well we can however stop buying into this bullshit theory that giving rich people tax breaks trickles down in any meaningful way all it does it give the rich the obvious and constant fiscal advantage in all markets its not about how much you make its about how much you profit and how much you can therefore expand your business sure a single small business pays less than 10 small businesses combined into a money sharing corporate entity but they also pay a higher proportion of their income leaving less at the end of the money per person per business for them to compete with what market cant the wealthy just buy up with wholesale tactics and tax breaks that always scale in the favor of wealth  we could all just pay 30 of our income and then at least the playing field is even from the side of taxes every man has a fair chance in what they have to spend in taxes to do x amount of business thats what the constitution meant with it said fair or equal taxes its not the value thats important its how much that money represents vs income the rich still get richer but at least they dont do it through taxes also the only tax system that makes sense is a set proportional tax such as 30 everything else benefits the rich such as flat taxes or the ever shifting proportional tax system we have today even under obama the rich will be paying far less of their income in taxes than the middle class yet their mega corporations ride all over the mostly publicly funded road system and dump waste into public lands it makes no sense we are subsidizing the rich so they can get rich even faster we need a new system and it needs controls of some kind living in fear of change while getting shafted by corporate america and subsidizing them through taxes is fucking retarded the question is not if we need controls aka laws or not its what laws we need stop posturing it as some scare tactic they are controlling you no its just regulation on the private industry which seems to repeat its banking failure every 80 years or so overall even with major losses the system is making grand amounts of money the real limiting factor is oil and now the out of control cost of health care at over 22 trillion per year in america twice the cost per person of any other nation and more than most nations gdp we pay about half chinas gdp every year in health care and no most of that is not government spending its corporate oh and on top of that corporations also get to pay less for health care further making competition with them from smaller businesses impossible we are subsidizing the rich with both taxes and lowered health care premiums while our gop leaders negotiate and nonnegotiation pact with the insurance companies im just saying conservative or liberal alike nobody things nonnegotiable prices is a good idea yet this is how the republicans have been spending your money and you cant just blame them for screwing up you have to turn it into a conspiracy of collapse it seems pathetic to me to even suggest without the slightest shred of proof its something someone on psychiatric drugs would say and then chant for richard nixon i think you fail to consider that while the political elite crash the nation that pesky old democracy might come up with any number of crazy plans to fix things why would the rich rolling along at record levels of wealth and profit decide you know what lets just crash the economy and put the democrats in office for awhile do you see how the rich have no incentive to crash the economy when their wealth is just going up anyway  why would they rock the boat to such a degree when you were already rich risking inflation deflation crashes most of which you cant fully avoid sure they rich have the most to gain but they also have the most to lose the rest of us stand by like the pawns we are i wouldnt

from what i have heard here is the real problem we are facing 1 it usually starts with a father the father either dies at a young age is a drunk or leaves his family to fend for themselves 2 the oldest child ends up taking the place of the father and works himself to the bone from a young age he takes care of his brothers sisters and mother he becomes a proud ethical hard working man 3 the son grows up to be a father himself he is a father any child can be proud of he works himself to the bone to provide everything he can for his family because he himself was denied so much as a child 4 the children of this man leave home well nurtured cared for and loved they learn hard work and ethics from their father these children go on to become great people they want nothing more in life to make their father proud and repay him for all he has done for them 5 some of these children go on to start businesses that they turn into empires their work ethic is top notch their morals are high they want to provide a better life for their own children they spoil them with all the things they themselves could have only dreamed of as children 6 the next generation of children take over the empires their fathers started but they never hard a truly hard life and dont carry with them all the empathy that their own fathers had 7 their fathers have raised the bar they are going to have to work twice as hard in order to earn their respect they work so hard their children get very little time with them the morals and ethics their fathers before them passed through the generations are slowly being lost the children are losing touch with the common person and their work ethic is diminishing 8 the children find that they dont even have to work hard in school because of who their father is and his influence they find that most things in life come very easy for them at this point they lose more touch with the common man they start seeing themselves as superior 9 the children grow up and have their own children these children are even more spoiled and their education even easier to obtain they are terrible at running the businesses that have been passed down to them and they are so spoiled at this point that instead of trying to improve the business to make more money they simply cut workers pay and anything else that helps them continue their life of luxury at this point all morals and ethics are gone completely 10 people are noticing that these children are terrible at their jobs and are running the companies into the ground but they have so many powerful connections and their complete lack of morals and ethics allows them to screw over pretty much everybody to continue to hold on to their slipping power they will get bailouts from their incompetent counterparts in politics who have pretty much followed the same path they will not even consider diminishing their own life style one bit this is typically when revolution must begin to remove the incompetents and start the whole process over again i wonder what kind of people obamas great grandchildren will be,politics

that is because there is nothing constructive to add danger there is no constructive way out of this situation what is the opposite of construction there you have what i am aiming at there is no other course the elite cannot be reasoned with because they use an entirely different moral lexicon than myself or any normal joe nobody this is an eternal struggle that has been played out forever in monetary societies brave and strong men go out and build destroying whatever was in the way previously be it nature or another civilization little weak men come along afterwards with laws and regulate and control the strong men even more repugnant fellows follow for years wringing profit from the constructive edifice of what is now a society the looting of societies temporal edifice eventually rots away the foundation of the society itself the cycle repeats when the oppressed strong and brave men behold their weapons and their tools and the labors before them smiling they take up the plow and the sword once more to try again i didnt make this cycle it is not my will that causes humanity to behave this way i think it is worse than many realize because the days when the poor could just simply leave the city of the elite and go out into the country and build a new society are over you think i paint with too broad of a stroke but i tell you that civilization is not art it is not a highly stylized piece of art to adorn a mantle a society is not supposed to be pretty the wide brush is far better for society a society merely need function in such a way that the people who live inside of it are content and those who live outside of it are content or impotent to stop it it must be balanced but balance isnt art every piece of lasting construction known to man is balanced but hardly artful and even if you wanted to make civilization into a piece of art you certainly could not do that without a fresh canvas perhaps as a species we can do better than the merely temporarily function edifice of society we routinely create and pilfer perhaps we can but if we are to even have that chance the current canvas will have to be removed i would much rather have been an artisan contributing to a society rather than just another vengeful man with dynamite lurking within it but i must tell you that this is a crooked and wicked piece of time that we are living if you want to learn more meditate on the lesson of rudra and the blood drinking buddhas its not the only crooked piece of time humanity has endured i take hope from the fact that our species has endured many such wicked eras nevertheless i am at least cognizant and aware that i live in an era of calumny and avarice and as such i dont work to aid the cowardly and the greedy aid to the cowardly and greedy is what you are conditioned to think of as useful contributions to society because you dont know what is being done in your name with the power you have given to others you want to know what i suggest i suggest revolution a new constitutional convention and a whole new government to start over with in this way we can minimize the elite for a time and galvanize a new core of democratically minded citizens but this wont occur the elite have far to many people snowed and lied to modern propaganda techniques are virtually brainwashing so few know what is really going on in the world they have a retardedly rosy picture of their nation and what it does read the confessions of an economic hitman read that mans works and tell me why i should cooperate with the elite and fucking be constructive you tell that to all the people in the third world who are getting shit on for our capitalist democracy you tell that to the growing army of mendicants who try to wheedle money out of me on my way to work to lunch from lunch back to work and on my way home in interesting term capitalist democracy sounds almost like it is only the capitalists who get a vote doesnt it i assure you that is no accident so fuck it im done cooperating furthermore i am done listening to the rhetoric of cooperation and conformity to a busted set of immoral rules and behaviors that are destroying the very world we live on and require to survive you idiots might be snowed by another 8 years of rhetoric and propaganda but i will not be one term of that shit has been quite enough for me,politics

you make some good points and it is entirely possible that the us is entering its decline that it is not an entirely different empire than great britain at its highwater rome or athens at their peaks yet it is different in some key ways by virtue of history and luck the us is surrounded by oceans and difficult to invade or conquer it is also has a robust political system which has proven to be adaptable to many challenges that would have sank lesser empires under say monarchy or even dictatorship the strength of the us and of its political system is that it relieves the pressure of an angry population by providing the illusion of and sometimes actual change every two to four years making it difficult for the population to remain angry and embittered because the top rotates unlike the former soviet union for example where anger could be directed at the top man or even at the system itself thus weakening it that is why when depression struck the world during the 1930s the us did not turn to a dictator or a revolution the system itself provided a valve for pent up anger and the system endured it will endure this crisis to and the only thing that will bring it down for good will be either the technological supremacy of another nation which can then become more powerful than and possibly able to destroy and at the very least contain the us or it will be the case that the us gradually disappears into a wasteland of crime and disordered slums torn apart by civil war and economic catastrophe of its own design,worldnews

w somerset maugham wrote in his introduction to the razors edge  another reason that has caused me to embark upon this work with apprehension is the persons i have chiefly to deal with are american it is very difficult to know people and i dont think one can ever really know any but ones own countrymenand because you cannot know persons of a nation foreign to you except by observation it is difficult to give them credibility in the pages of a book even so subtle and careful and observer as henry james though he lived in england for forty years never managed to create an englishman who was through and through englishi do not pretend that the characters in this book are american as americans see themselves they are american as seen through an english eye  largely and often indirectly the kind of stereotypical cartoonish english referenced by americans and in a way you say is completely fabricated and has no basis in reality can be traced to the wooster and jeeves stories which are themselves the template for english stereotypes in american cartoons and so forth hence indirectly as few of this generation have actually read any of the wooster and jeeves stories as far as adding chap to the end of a sentence ill take your word on that but more broadly you will find a lot of the other stuff in the wodehouse books great scott and so forth and of course the point is that these stories are a parodies of the english upper class with exaggeration and purposefully ridiculous language that said  of course old man i only saw the kid once and then only for a moment butbut it _was_ an ugly sort of kid wasnt it if i remember rightly as ugly as that i looked again and honesty compelled me to be frank i dont see how it could have been old chap ýçùþêüåûêçêüçùçúýûîàøúçêæùªøêùëùìé  my man jeeves so while it may well be wrong you can blame or should in any case alert the wodehouse estate for poisoning the minds of millions of americans,worldnews

i think obamas job questionnaire is fair theyre trying to dig out any facts that may cause controversy in the future how about obamaappointed official married to man that shot his motherinlaw while cleaning gun i dont like guns but i recognize the rights granted second amendment as obama does however we can all agree that the amendments are high level and thats why the judiciary particularly the us supreme court has interpreted and applied the constitution to specific cases where clarification is needed for example unfettered access to guns no background checks is not guaranteed were not guaranteed completely free speech either  the interpretation has included a limitation such that you cant use speech to incite violence or yell fire in a crowded theater if were drawing a parallel between motor vehicles and guns as the author in the article did lets talk about why cars must be registered and guns dont always have to be why is that just throwing it out there my initial thought is well cars are on the road with other people and in the hands of a distracted or incompetent driver can bring harm to other people law enforcement needs to know who the vehicle belongs to so that a culpability can be established if theres a hit and run b if an injured party in a car accident is unable to identify themselves unconscious dead etc theres a way of finding out similarly most of the time guns are used responsibly but if theyre used in a crime law enforcement needs to know who the owner is and investigate their involvement or the theft of the gun from that owner additionally in both cases you start with a clean slate youre granted a license to drive a vehicle after taking tests to prove your basic ability to safely operate the vehicle but if you violate traffic laws eg drive drunk or negligently and get enough points on your record that license is taken away for guns if you have clean record you get a gun are you even required to take a basic safety class in states where registration is required if youre a criminal whos committed a violent crime im not talking about someone who had a bag of marijuana you forfeit that right im primarily libertarian in my thinking i believe that states role is to ensure i can exercise my rights to life liberty and property and pursuit of happiness if you care to include it to do this they need to basically leave me alone unless i impinge on the rights of others protecting my negative rights right to not be killed by my neighbor is the most important role of government and i believe licensure is within scope of that role,politics
a good example of this sequence of events playing out would be the godfather ive never seen the movie but i assume it follows the book closely enough it starts with a man desperate to fend for his family who does whatever it takes to provide for his family he builds his empire but look what happens to his offspring ill use obama as an example as well not trying to pick on him but he fits the mold pretty well obamas parents were obviously some pretty incredible parents who through their own hard work and morals inspired him to become a great man his fathers life probably wasnt an easy one and obama wanting to make his father proud lead an even tougher and greater life will obamas daughters ever have to struggle to get by not anymore but they probably know by being with their dad what it means to work hard and sacrifice but will their children who will probably have a life of luxury and influence ever know a hard life doubtful their influence and power will still be great yet not because of their own achievements but of those who came before them i think this is just a flaw in human nature believing that greatness can be passed down george w might be a prime example of this,politics

lockean property is wholly incompatible with a true mutualist approach lockes concepts of property are defined in strictly individualist terms and to redefine the concept demands more than merely changing the word individual to individual or collective this is due largely to the fact that locke begins from the principles of god giving the earth to man and from self ownership there is an inherent paradox in deriving collective ownership from individual self ownership as the individual and the collective are discrete entities the resulting ownership is not actually collective ownership additionally locke defines his property in the context of the state and necessitates a state to enforce the rights it is oddly enough complete collective action that is able to secure individual rights robert nozicks book anarchy state and utopia explores in detail the problems of a nonstate system with lockean property in his book nozick demonstrates quite clearly that lockean property may not exist without a state or inevitably leads to the development of a state moreover lockean property demands that the individual ultimately be the functional unity of society this stands in stark contrast to mutualistic approaches to social organization where the collective and the individual are to be balanced rather than placed at odds with one another,worldnews

sharia is pretty much like any other codified legal system in that it has its pros and cons theoretically respect for women is enthroned in sharia however as everyone here knows the burden of proof is often placed too heavily on the woman i think the big problem redditors have with sharia is that it is essentially immutable the best a shariafollowing nation can do under sharia is to liberalize their interpretation you can see similar albeit less severe problems in british common law where the force of precedent is so strong that some things that wed consider to be absurd to be illegal technically are and it is just the prudence of the modern judiciary that prevents arcane past precedent from interfering with modern thought on legal behavior another example is the texas legal system as a kneejerk to the reconstruction govt the redemptionera texas state constitution which is still in effect crippled the state govt to the point where any significant new legislation has to be brought forward as a constitutional amendment for instance in a number of less populated parts of the state the county sheriffs office has become obsolete given the existence of municipal police forces and the texas highway patrol however the constitution mandated the office of a county sheriff so a couple of these counties had a figurehead sheriff elected every four years with practically no budget and no staff who would just occupy an office to meet the constitutional requirements in order for the counties to finally disestablish their sheriff we had to pass a constitutional amendment in 2004 back to the original point while we in texas could jump through hoops to make a change to the basis of our state legal system a sharia nation cannot,worldnews

i think some people here need to read the quran and what it commands its followers to do there is a reason for all the muslim terrorists in this world  the quran specifically demands it ive met some lovely muslims in my time and most of them are peaceful because they dont strictly adhere to the quran but you must never forget that there are many who still hold the book as sacred and will continue to martyr themselves in this age i think anyone that admits they follow the quran needs to be denied entry into a foreign country if i told customs officials i worshipped a god who commands me to kill anyone who doesnt submit to my religion i would be denied entry both of these texts are sacred to any strict muslim and there instructions are unequivocal should a later verse contradict these early verses the earlier verse is taken as correct quran sura 2191193  and slay them wherever ye find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out for persecution of muslims is worse than slaughter of nonbelieversand fight them until persecution is no more and religion is for allah sura 2216  fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not sura 3151  soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority sura 476  those who believe fight in the cause of allah sura 495  not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their goods and their persons allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home unto all in faith hath allah promised good but those who strive and fight hath he distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward this verse is especially disturbing it criticizes peaceful muslims sura 4104  and be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy if you suffer pain then surely they too suffer pain as you suffer pain take revenge thats what a peaceful religion does sura 533  the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement hadith bukhari 52177  allahs apostle said the hour will not be established until you fight with the jews and the stone behind which a jew will be hiding will say o muslim there is a jew hiding behind me so kill him kill the jews nuff said muslim 133  the messenger of allah said i have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but allah that muhammad is the messenger of allah bukhari 52256  the prophet was asked whether it was permissible to attack the pagan warriors at night with the probability of exposing their women and children to danger the prophet replied they ie women and children are from them ie pagans this passage establishes that its permissible to attack noncombatants in the pursuit of their enemy this lays the foundations for acceptance of terrorism today bukhari 8387  allahs apostle said i have been ordered to fight the people till they say none has the right to be worshipped but allah muslim 204645  he the messenger of allah did that and said there is another act which elevates the position of a man in paradise to a grade one hundred higher and the elevation between one grade and the other is equal to the height of the heaven from the earth he abu said said what is that act he replied jihad in the way of allah jihad in the way of allah the verses from the quran are standalone and are not part of a larger story so cannot be placed into context there are hundreds more like this thankfully most muslims do not follow the quran anymore but again some do ìêüùüúåêúîûþâóýëäúôèóäà,politics

ok how about we switch less useful to wrong and then you go ask msdn an allegory there was once a king and he was constantly afraid as he was a very small and weak man that if his subjects ever learned how to stand up for themselves they would throw off his rule and he would be left to fend for himself so he built a large police force and fed them steroids told them the other subjects were all criminalsinwaiting and even made special programs on the video box to glorify them as societys saviours and he put sedatives in the regular subjects food outlawed defensive weapons and bought up entire industries to promote the separation of families so that children would grow up without strong sane parents around he built ritualized warfare into sports to sublimate male tribal defense instincts and whenever the population of adult males got too big hed call up his neighbor king and theyd have wars to cull the males of the herd this worked well but never quite made him feel safe so he went further in the past there were people who resented the king and fought to be free then when he had arrested and killed most of those he realized his people had no enemy to be scared of so he instructed his police to provocateur incidents so that he could keep up the pretense of protecting the people from something anything other than the king himself and when the blond haired blue eyed perps were witnessed he had his noozpaperz just outright lie and say that there were only brown men and when the evidence showed that the provocateurs came from the wrong place he had his apparatus outright lie again and claim that they came from a place with absolutely no connection to the event but had a strategic reserve of blueberries which the king was particularly fond of and his police used violence and threats to convince the witnesses they had been mistaken  those who refused to recant were called combatants of the enemy and were never heard from again and knowing above all else that if the people discovered that he had done all of it himself this they would lynch him he made sure that his entire apparatus constantly drummed up the one word that gave his pathetic protection racket a claim to exist fear,worldnews

but how do you judge the degree of force or violence i truly do not believe a swat on the butt harms a child but i do not give myself permission to lay a hand on my children in anger because of my past i know if i started when i was upset i might not stop and believe it or not i am glad i went through what i did   i will never hit my kids i took the abuse so they dont have to  and this is a blessing for me edgar cayce warning touchy feely hippy crap here says when you die you relive everything you have done from the point of view of the person you were interacting with  i could cry just thinking of the pain my parents suffered feeling what they did to me and my brother my dad always said we all make mistakes with our kids and one of his favorite quotes was the mark twain quote when i was a boy of 14 my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around but when i got to be 21 i was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years trouble is i never got to that point they were wrong and they knew it as they got older,politics
gtthe limit of severity of beatings that are accepted by society is continually improving in the direction of less injury people have always debated the limit just as saudis debate how much a husband may beat his wife comparing spanking your child to an islamic man beating his wife is like comparing a kid that takes a magnifying glass to an ant to hitler two wrongs indeed do not make a right and on that we can agree however you are not in the wrong in any way unless you are beating your child out of rage or exasperation gtactually the state you describe of screaming is disincentive enough its horrible to be in that state its horrible to be in that state but it is a state that the child has learned to induce when he isnt getting his way by letting him have his way he will stop screaming but it reinforces the behavior i can scream to get what i want the politically correct solution is to do exactly as the mom did until she confronted him nothing when a child throws a tantrum it is to get attention of either the parent or others and if the parent pays no attention to the bad behavior it is typically enough to teach the child that screaming and throwing a fit however superficial isnt going to achieve their goals when the mother confronted the child she played into his game as it were chocolate bars are cheap but in this example it doesnt matter if it was a chocolate bar or a bmw the child was in the wrong for reacting that way and it was due to a precedent of not being disciplined for actions similar to that being set,politics
pretty cool allegory but i dont think its very fitting of the us  its a democracy sedatives in the food i dont know i dont believe there are so many csi shows because the govnmt wants so etc thats the stuff conspiracy theories are made of most people who are against liberal gun laws think that giving someone a gun wont make him capable of preventing further mayhem rather making him another risk factor or more precisely that for every incident where legal gun ownership helped there are two where it made the situation worse im not sure if thats actually true btw but i dont outright dismiss it  pretty often peoplekids get hurt in stupid gun accidents or some vigilante shoots a trespasser or the man his wife is cheating on him with my original point was probably if they believed guns would make people better at preventing tragedies i doubt they would be against them another example pulling out a gun in a moving fully occupied bus to prevent someone ten rows in front of you from stabbing the guy next to him will most likely kill more people than just the stabber and probably wont even save the victim ive had a lively discussion on reddit with a proguns person who thought this would have been a good way to resolve this situation also i dont think that guns would make the big difference in protecting the usa from turning into a dictatorship should that happen however i also dont think making gun ownership illegal now would help  rather the opposite im not really decided if it makes that much of a difference at all  canada or switzerland are states where everybody has a gun and crime rates are low,worldnews

oh you want me to debunk a 10 minute video as if youll even think about what i write and whats in it for me a demeaning lecture about how im blind to the truth the fundamental problem with this video is one i doubt youll fully accept this is a video made for you not for me its made for you and other people in your religion okay not religion school of thought its made for you to watch and rally behind it specifically preaches the message you believe in but from the outsiders perspective well imagine attending a islamic church service if youre not islamic while a litany is recited you will probably wonder why they think certain things so heres a rundown first 2 minutes eisenhower and jfk  jfk assassination  dramatic music  some more out of context quotes and wild speculation set a nice backdrop for this piece quigley is quoted and he of course a prophet of your religion we are given one short quote from him again out of context he wrote books and were given one short quote were not even given a full sentence the actual quote doesnt include the subject or verb of the sentence its just a prepositional phrase it is followed by speculation added by the creator of this video that they want to control the entire world and that the cfr is the most visible conduit for carrying out that agenda so note that hes alleging that the cfr will carry out the cfrs alleged agenda through the cfr this is the kind of thing that makes the video seem a little hair brained stan jones alex jones and glenn beck are quoted wow what a lot of credibility these names confer many unjustified claims are given at this point i am wonder why people take this as fact so now we are talking about the north american union and the amero believe it or not there is no evidence that anyone desires to create a north american union theres the security and prosperity partnership of north america which has different goals and has no ties to the cfr and people are concerned that theyre going to build highways connecting canada and mexico oh no dont look now but these roads already exist now were talking about how theres the eu the african union and the asia cooperation dialogue these are all completely different organizations with different goals that are obviously run by different people i know the video claims otherwise but its just the guy talking and guess what unsubstantiated he also claims they will be merged why does he you or anyone think that i mean shucks it may happen but what makes you think thats a more likely outcome than anything else now we have a rockefeller and cheney talking about something mostly unrelated then glenn beck claims both sides are selling us out both parties are a disappointment but why does this man saying this contribute anything to this video now hillary is talking about how she was pro iraq war duh thats why we all hated her here on reddit now we have pictures of people next to cfr logos oh theres your proof for that to mean something you have to first accept that the cfr is trying to create the nwo this is not really clear and again zero context just pictures what are they even saying at the cfr at about 715 we have some english douchebag sharing his opinions nice next more of some douchebag complaining about the similarities of the two parties in america great i find that frustrating too but what does that have to do with anything oh right cuz you think the point is that elections dont change anything because that proves that the nwo is real and he also says they are controlled by the same interests right why do i believe him now bush sr is talking about a nwo but hes obviously talking about order in the sense that ideally democracy and rule of law would be the rule and not the exception frankly i am in favor of his new world order if only it was something more than words but lets strip his quote of all context and pretend its part of our case and lets zoom in on his head ominously now im going to have nightmares ron paul this is why i have always thought he was a crank why believe him two quotes of kissinger again stripped of all context he basically says nothing more than new international order twice that proves it next some completely random douchebag proving nothing more than people believe this a lot of people also believe in reincarnation but obviously that cant be true because there are more and more people on earth at any given point in time next many random people saying new world order among them is bill clinton not present context youll note that this video provides zero context for any of these it is just random quote after random quote stitched together in an order that makes the case what would happen if you put these in chronological order and when you have a single guy sit down and explain this all attempting to give proof and context what happens the case comes across weakly andor the guy sounds flat out nuts oh i forgot to add that ive seen zeitgeist freedom to fascism loose change and a few other of your tracts just saying that so you know i dont just need to watch more educational material,politics

once again stop being arrogant we know muhammad endured hardship from abu lahab to the quraish muhammad was tested for his claims i could open each post with you obviously have no idea about islam but im only interested in discussing the facts at mecca muhammad was right to defend himself but he took it too far instead of leaving he raised an army to fight in the name of his religion unfortunately instead of an intelligent and peaceful passage about using defence only in the most dire of circumstances this was put into the quran and slay them wherever ye find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out for persecution of muslims is worse than slaughter of nonbelieversand fight them until persecution is no more and religion is for allah i ask you how does knowing context change the meaning of the verse however you look at it muhammad is condoning violence if even in self defence the real problem is that as i explained to grin below no definitive boundaries have been set for those who fight against you 2190 it is entirely subjective  physically emotionally mentally like so much of the quran it can be interpreted differently depending on ones mood and circumstances this isnt the sort of definitive religious holy book we need in circulation now the quotes you give from the quran are about these wars where the prophet was given permission by allah to fight back to preserve their rights to worship their own beliefs as you are hopefully well aware the quote is still active thanks mainly to the islamic doctrine alnasikh walmansoukh not even an attempt was made to recuse these temporary powers of war given to islam later in the quran unintentionally or willfully i believe muhammad was a very intelligent and very powerhungry man islam is still militaristic because of verses like these i dont think youre evil i think you grew up in a muslim home and have never properly researched other religions i dont think youve ever been able to objectively view your own i understand that too its hard to critically analyze something we love our emotions will always get in the way all i ask is that you do your own research and not try to colour me as stupid because of your own inadequacies to reason insults are the simple mans argument have a nicer day,politics
