Here, this challenge is imagined as two-fold: analysts must determine which patterns are \"meaningful\" and analysts must apply the appropriate methods and tools to extract these meaningful patterns.\n",

    "Analysts must also match guiding questions with an appropriate technique. They must be observant to how the methods and tools used to measure a corpus also give shape to the corpus and our analysis.\n",

       " firstly id encourage you to go back and read my original post as ive added several more paragraphs to it that i think are worth redaing im glad you liked the legitimate ignorance phrase but you ascribed to it a different meaning than what i meant i was basically saying the modernday politician has legitimate reason to fear that say voting the right way on a bill will be mistaken by constituents as going against their will they have to worry for example that voting against an iraq spending bill will be seen as not supporting the troops rather than trying to end an unpopular and wrongheaded war in other words the people are so ignorant that an honest politician would probably wind up with his own wellmeaning words and votes turned against him in the next election i was watching the david price vs bj lawson a north carolina congressional candidate and favorite heir to ron paul among pauls suppporters debate last week and price kept citing things like the nih dept of education etc saying i believe my opponent considers these things unconstitutional and he hasnt said a word in response each time ive brought this up and lawson continued to ignore the comments rather than respond except for a weak attempt 30 minutes later in his closing statement because he probably realized that the audience was so lacking in understanding of constitutional lawtheory that any attempt to explain those positions in the short timeframe of a debate would be impossible and likely backfire even more than continuing to ignore prices frequent incisive comments thats a good example of what i mean by legitimate ignorance its a sympathy for the wellintentioned politicians not the american people if lawson had tried to respond the honest response would have had to be you the audience are too unfamiliar with the constitution for me to explain these positions in the time im given here today so basically telling the audience theyre ignorant and that doesnt help you win votes because its sort of builtin to the definition of being ignorant that you dont consider yourself ignorant and take offense to the phrase even if objectively its true further i dont think the people are justified in their ignorance in the way you described for the middle class i dont think its as hard to keep track of whether politicians are serving the public interest as you suggest because they need to find only one example of betrayal to draw a conclusion especially if you have a computer and an internet connection look at how much time people spend having superficial debates among friendsfamily and watching tv coverage of politics if they would spend a little of that time doing some modest research they would know pretty quickly and its the chattering classes that really shape the elections if the middle class had the right points of view it would filter down to a certain extent to the poor to another extent it wouldnt but thats ok because as i said even a small minority can be very powerful and the middle class are in fact a very large minority and the poor arguably get screwed over the most by the status quo so they have the most to gain from committing the proper time even if its difficult the standard for serving the public interest should be so strict that you wouldnt need much evidence we should not be tolerant of political corruption at all find one example of a politician acting counter to the will of the people and that should be it in real life personal relations you only really get one chance as soon as you do something blatantly disloyal youre typically gone and if youre not its because your friendsfamilyspouse weigh your disloyalty against your long history of loyalty in the case of politicians we have no close history with them theyre doing a job and even a single act of intentional disloyalty should not be tolerated you probably ask well if both major praty politicians are disloyal at least one of them will be elected that may be true but if people would bydefault vote against the disloyal incumbent that would be a major step forward at least it is our willingness to compromise on integrity and be understanding of the fact that politicians have to sell out to stay in office that has led us down this slippery slope of increasinglyflagrant betrayals why are we sympathetic to the career politician protecting their career plenty of people are willing to be noncareer politicians serving a single term or two for their country and then returning to their original field of work holding an elected office should be considerd public service not a professional career the process for winning a primary election is quite a bit easier than winning a general any time the impassioned minority succeed in getting a fresh challenger through the primary process as they did with bj lawson if the public would say well this guy is a newcomer to politics so we dont know if hell betray us but hes better in that sense than the incumbent politician who has already betrayed us that would make progress in american a bit more of a reality at least,\n",

       " the british government as well remember it was the balfour declaration in 1917 that got the whole thing rolling in 1917 just before britain defeated the ottoman turks and seized control of palestine from them british foreign secretary lord balfour issued the balfour declaration which stated that they would view with favour the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people with the understanding that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonjewish communities in palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country this fell short of the goals of the zionist lobby in britain since it did not actually establish an independent jewish state the declaration itself was woefully naive since there were already anywhere from 500000 to 600000 nonjewish palestinians living there compared to 80000 or so jewish immigrants from europe and native jewish palestinians between the wars britain continued to be the strongest supporter of zionism but some interesting things happened fascism was on the rise and while hitlers munich putsch in 1923 failed mussolini had taken over italy author and activist lenni brenner details a lot of the connections in the book zionism and fascism including how zionists of the time sought an alliance with mussolini and even sent letters to nazi leaders as late as 1941 urging them to deport jews to palestine zionism in the interwar years became skeptical of democracy and fell in love with a racial identitybased authoritarian state zionism evolved in a similar way to the falangist movement in spain and despite the perpetration of the holocaust by the nazi government zionists still saw fascism as the ideology most suited to their task  creating a jewish state basically democracy for us but none for you palestinian arabs britain was also not that thrilled with zionism anymore jewish immigration in mass numbers was one cause of the arab revolt in palestine from 1936 to 1939 and britain clamped down on immigration this prompted zionists in palestine to become better organized clandestine and more supportive of the use of terrorist and paramilitary tactics however after world war 2 britain until now zionisms chief sponsor government was ruined by the war and losing its empire abroad two things then happened the greek civil war and the end of the british mandate over palestine facing more and more battles with jewish militants britain unilaterally announced its withdrawal from palestine on the day before the british mandate was set to expire zionists within palestine declared the creation of a jewish state in violation of the un partition plan  and this will be a very brief description that follows  this immediately provoked a civil war and foreign intervention after a year of fighting and what could now be described as ethnic cleansing directed against nonjews by groups such as haganah and later irgun the state of israel was declared in greece communists were fighting to overthrow the government there many of the communists had just fought against the occupying germans while the government was returning from exile the uk supported the greek government into this stepped the united states as britain became unable to lend its support any longer us president harry truman laid out what became known as the truman doctrine in reference to greece and turkey specifically but offering to aid any nation or people who were resisting communism and implicitly the soviet union then in 1956 egyptian president nasser who came to power in a coup in 1952 declared that he was nationalizing the suez canal and this lead to a secret alliance between israel and britain and france who were the prime stockholders in the suez canal the united states forced a ceasefire only after the soviet union threatened to intervene with nuclear weapons if the canal was not reopened the cold war and access to oil shaped the usisraeli relationship first when it appeared that arabs states could be kept in the proamerican camp 19501967 relations with israel were muted  more aid was given to jordan than israel after the 1967 sixday war between israel and syria egypt and jordan the arab states shifted more or less into the soviet sphere of influence this was the real turning point the usisraeli relationship therefore was first due to cold war antisoviet policy it was only later justified in terms of religious obligation by christian fundamentalists and the israeli lobby in the united states or antiterrorism policy  in the eyes of the us government in the context of the cold war israel was portrayed in the media as the little guy standing up to a big bully either taking on three or four countries at once and defeating them or in reference to the soviet union keep in mind this was also in the aftermath of world war 2 and the horrors of the holocaust although just as many nonjews were slaughtered in the holocaust as jews the zionist lobby was quick to move on the implications of this and reinforce the idea that judaism and israel were one and the same and that criticism of the state of israel was antisemitic but culturally there was also massive jewish immigration to the united states in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century and all of these immigrants spoke yiddish and either russian german or other european language for zionists diaspora culture iswas also a direct threat to the idea of the jewish state why because traditionally jews believed they would continue to be exiled from their homeland in diaspora until the coming of the messiah establishing a homeland presupposes the messiah has arrivedbut he hasnt therefore the state of israel is heretical to traditional judaic beliefs yiddish language and culture is a part of that so after world war 2 we see a massive transformation of jewishamerican culture yiddish is abandonedrejected and hebrew the language of modern israel is embraced as well as the notion that israel  judaism and judaism  israel because zionism is the foundational ideology of the state of israel therefore the thought arose that zionism  judaism this is deliberate as american jews largely accepted this it created an instant de facto lobby for israeli interests still most mainstream support for the state of israel in the united states by people like joe the plumber who should have no reason to have an opinion one way or the other can only be traced back to about 1980 or so its a fairly recent phenomenon tied in part to fundamentalist christians with their belief in end times and apocalypse coming to power alongside reagan republicans and in part due to energy policy and foreign policy following the rise of the islamic revolution in iran in 1979 people can say what they want about jewish conspiracies in clearly antisemitic terms but it has nothing to do with that  it has everything to do with how politics is played all over the world and throughout history zionism is a political ideology that is racereligion based  just as fascism is inherently racenation based and communism is inherently class based judaism happens to be the religion that zionism is founded on but they are not the same thing sorry this was so complex,\n",

america are unhappy and antisocial citizens whose ancestors were granted refuge in north america in the eighteenth century witness the testimony of the king of dahomey who ruled much of the congo basin who assumed the throne of that nation at age eighteen in about 1820 and who died the same day as queen victoria in 1900 making him one of the longest ruling monarchs in history the only interview he ever granted was to henry morton stanley in about 1870 he assured stanley that every person over four years of age within the entire congo basin regularly ate human flesh social infractions of any kind hooliganism or indeed casting ones eyes upon the king guaranteed a one way trip to the town butcher the victims were auctioned in the marketplaces a piece at a time thus a customer would purchase a leg for instance or a hand or the liver and would receive a token then when the whole body was sold the victim would be dispatched and the tokens exchanged for his body parts it was the refugees from cannibalism that made up the bulk of african immigration into america all a ship had to do was anchor anywhere in the congo delta and they would swarm aboard a situation that continues to this day consider the spectacle of a couple of hundred battalions of somali tribesmen rampaging across rural north america while the african americans rampage thru the cities like they did in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in new orleans killing and rounding up and interning the whites in the camps a well planned military operation would be able to immobilize most of north

       " it could be said that all this time when believing we were using addition we were operating under the rules of quaddition a system which seems exactly like addition except that after you attempt to add any two numbers larger than 57 your sum would always be 57 suppose hypothetically that all of the addition you have ever done involved terms that were below this number 57 or if need be we could take an incomprehensibly giant number that no one has likely ever added before all of your addition which is really quaddition works fine 22  4 53  8 etc etc but after a certain point whilst you mistakenly think you are adding you get up to numbers 57 and larger in attempting to add 57 and 68 together you get 125 but you were doing quaddition and so your quum sum should have been 5 why should you be any better off by saying 125 than 5 if your justification is that this method whether it be addition or quaddition was that it worked so well for you in the past how can we clearly say what it is we had done from kripke when we wish to add x and y we can do so with a bunch of marbles for example any kind of unit first count out x marbles in one heap then count out y marbles in another heap then put the two heaps together and count out the number of marbles just formed but then attempts the skeptic what was this counting you have performed if saying the sum which is the number means having been able to have counted certain clumps that were its constituent parts then this operation was already a part of the terms 57 and 68 which we had already allowed even stating 125 is identified with the process of addition there is no meaningful difference between 125 and 5768 attempt to define 57 a term we had allowed you will have to resolve it into its constituent parts smaller numbers and the process of addition the concept of counting or of addition is presupposed even in our ability to talk about these numbers to start with if the skeptic then asks how can we know that 57  68 ought to be 125 and speaks as though he knows what 57 are and what 68 are we must point out that he couldnt actually know what those numbers were without also knowing what addition was can the question be adjusted can we say for this unknown value which is called 57 and this other unknown one 68 be added with any justification or sense the question is meaningless until we even know what the values are or why we should be concerned with them or we can just insist that the problem applies just the same with those original terms the skeptic was playing nice allowing those problematic terms as though they made sense in order to pose his question though now the presence of his question would undercut the sense of even asking it supposing he had a point suppose it is an adequate definition to resolve 57 into component parts of itself but we were able to not even add merely count numbers at the outset to be given a lump of units of any type how do we decide what are and are not units      from whence come our definitions from at the outset something assumed beforehand values values are self sufficient they give their full justification in the moment of their being experienced and their seeming is no different from what they actually are they are as they seem to you and about them you can not be mistaken in recieving it though you can in interpreting and valuing it after the fact,\n",
