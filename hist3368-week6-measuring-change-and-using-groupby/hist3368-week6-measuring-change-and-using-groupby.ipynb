    "Understanding how to group data is essential for performing a number of operations on pandas DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Groupby refers to a process involving one or more of the following steps: \n",
    " - splitting the data into groups based on some criteria.\n",
    " - applying a function to each group independently.\n",
    " - combining the results into a data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is that with `groupby()` we can group categories and then apply functions to the categories instead of to the entire data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before showing code examples of `groupby()` let's get a quick conceptual overview of what it means to perform a function to a category as opposed to the entire data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following image, a sample of the Hansard data. If we were to group this data by decade it would be as though we stuck each decade into a bucket to be operated upon independantly from the rest of the data."

    "We have a good representation of wordcount here.  Although I want to emphasize that we are, technically, *doing everything wrong*.  It is almost never the case that the most frequent words are the most interesting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, however, we've used stopwording to chisel away at the word list, until we have a pretty interesting story -- the decline of the president, the rise of the people; a shift from the \"world\" to \"care.\"  It's the start of something -- but I'm not sure what it means yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why, in your assignments in previous weeks, we've asked you to use a controlled vocabulary to choose particular words.  You could use such a controlled vocabulary to refine the chart above, for example, to zoom in on the conversation about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's another problem too, however.  The numbers in this chart are deceptive; if we were measuring them over decades ,they would be even more problematic.  There's just a lot of noise -- look at all those colors jumbled together.  This is an excellent case for using _averages_ over time -- moving from month to year -- and _proportions_ -- measuring word count against how many words were spoken in a period.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't take any more averages right now -- although above, when we \"groupby\" month_year and then take the sum for that period, you could easily switch in year for month_year and/or \"mean\" for \"sum,\" and play with what would happen then.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll look at taking wordcounts as a proportion rather than a raw count.  Above, where we counted the number of words per date, we saw that there was a huge variation in words spoken per day.  The numbers we've charted per word are meaningless without some sense of how they represent other variations in speaking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the great tools for measuring change over time is to \"normalize\" word counts.  Simply put, we take the ratio: number of times the word \"bill\" appears vs number of words spoken in that period."
