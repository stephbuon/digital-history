    "This notebook is designed to introduce you to another cleaning step, called 'stemming' or 'lemmatization.'  Previously, we learned to clean text by lowercasing text, removing punctuation, and removing stopwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "When scholars practice wordcount, they often want to make singulars and plurals the same, so that the following words could be counted the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * giraffe\n",
    "    * giraffes\n",
    "    \n",
    "The easy way to fix this prblem is called \"stemming.\" In stemming, we tell the computer to look for common endings -- like 's,' 'ed,' and 'ing' -- and remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that process won't work for irregular words in English, for instance the following words:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * wolf / wolves\n",
    "    * woman / women\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, linguists have compiled lists of irregular words and their 'root lemma,' which is to say the 'wolf' in 'wolves.'  The process of 'lemmatization' is looking for irregular words and replacing them with their lemmas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **worddnet** command from the **nltk** package -- which was designed by linguists -- to lemmatize text correctly."
