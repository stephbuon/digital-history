    "We've been counting many things so far: stop-worded words and words from a controlled vocabulary, words over time, grammatical constructions and parts of speech.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, what one really wants to know is not the *raw* counts, but rather how two or more categories of counts compare to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, imagine that Steph and Jo are friends.  Imagine that they pool their emails to each other into a dataset.  The top words for both of the friends are almost all the same: \"time,\" \"when,\" \"friend,\" \"meet\", \"thanks,\" \"work,\" etc.  The words that are quantitatively the most frequent aren't very informative.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if I measure the words that only *one friend* uses and the other friend doesn't, those words are very interesting: \"bike,\" \"handlebar,\" \"crampon,\" \"scuba,\" etc.  We can learn from these words what sports and hobbies are enjoyed by one friend and not the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because we've introduced a new rule -- we're looking for words that one person uses but not both -- we're finding \"distinctive\" words.  These words that may not be the most frequent overall, but they are nevertheless some of the most informative.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Looking for the most *distinctive* words for each of us takes you straight to the give-away clues that I'm a cyclist and my friend is a cave-diver. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Log Likelihood as a Score of Distinctiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "Just so, in this notebook, we're going to learn how to use one of the most common statistical measures for calculating \"distinctiveness.\"  That measure is \"log likelihood.\"  Technically, it's a mathematical improvement on the naive version that I describe here, where I look for my-email(not my-friend's-email), because it performs a calculation that results in a \"log likelihood score,\" which is a guess by the computer of how \"distinctive\" a word is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied to the example above, the output might look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Jo's most distinctive words, with their distinctiveness scores calculated by log-likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "    bike : 1\n",
    "    handlebar: 1\n",
    "    lube: 1\n",
    "    chain : .3\n",
    "    path : .3\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steph's most distinctive words, with their distinctiveness scores calculated by log-likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "    scuba : 1\n",
    "    backroll: 1\n",
    "    bootie: 1\n",
    "    buoyancy: .9\n",
    "    tank : .3\n",
    "    mask : .3\n",
    "    cave : .3\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there's a lot more information with these scores than in the way I originally described the experiment. The score of .3 for \"path,\" \"cave,\" etc. Show you that there are some words that I tend to use more than my friend, and conversely her more than me -- but we both *sometimes* use these words.  They're only 30% distinctive, whereas words like \"bike\" or \"scuba\" that only one of us uses are 100% distinctive, and therefore have a higher score. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Log Likelihood equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what it looks like for one word, \"bike.\" We need four pieces of input and one calculation: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        a = how many times the word \"bike\" appears in Jo's email\n",
    "        b = how many times the word \"bike\" appears in everyone else's email -- Steph's, and if we're measuring others as well, those other friends too: let's say Audre's and Beth's\n",
    "        c = how many times OTHER words than \"bike\" \n",
    "        d = how many times OTHER words than \"bike\" appear in everyone else's email --  which is the equivalent of all the words in the corpus, minus a, minus b, minus c\n",
    "        total_corpus_words = the total number of words in the corpus.  This should be the equivalent of a + b + c + d.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Next, we make three calculations to get the log likelihood score:\n",
    "\n",
    "        E1 = (a + c) * (a + b) / total_corpus_words \n",
    "        E2 = (b + d) * (a + b) / total_corpus_words \n",
    "        \n",
    "        LL = 2 * (a * log(a / E1)) + 2 * b * log(b / E2)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're a math nerd, you might think about how we're taking a calculation of the specificity of \"a\" (how often I write \"bike\") relative to \"c\" (how many words I wrote in all) and the number of total corpus words, and conversely how specific \"bike\" is to other people (b, d). \n",
    "\n",
    "The function \"log\" normalizes both calculations.  Further multiplications make the calculations more specific to \"a\" (my usage of the word) and \"b\" (my friends' usage of the word).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel overwhelmed: don't worry about this section.  Just accept that we're creating a numerical score of distinctiveness.  It's more important, in this class, to be able to use the distinctiveness measure than to understand where it comes from.  So long as you can run the code in the one section where we tell Python to execute a log likelihood score, you should be fine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why you want to know about distinctiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinctiveness scores can be applied to anything. If you're trying to understand what makes speakers in Congress different from each other, you can recreate the above experiment with their words and get a working definition of how different each is -- one that will be far more meaningful than the list of top words used by each, or the words used by only one but not the other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But you can also do so much more with this wonderful, flexible measure! You can use it to improve your understanding of time. You can use distinctiveness measures to figure out which words were more distinctive of the 1970s than the 1980s, or the 1980s than the 1990s -- and you can then make *those* words the subject of your charts over time or your questions about which speaker introduced a particularly meaningful word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All you have to do is understand some basic questions about how to format data, how to perform a statistical calculation, and how to use that calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this notebook will do\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will use a sample dataset from EDGAR, the quarterly reports of American corporations.  It will walk you through reformatting the data to get rid of punctuation and words that only appear once (which may be typos, and which, in any case, will throw off the log likelihood calculations, making them less useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then bring in some tools from the SKLEARN package of statistics and machine learning software, especially CountVectorizer(), vectorizer.get_feature_names(),  and vectorizer.todense().  \n",
    "\n",
    "A \"vector\" is a matrix of words and their frequency, representing every word in the corpus.  For instance, for the example above, a descriptive vector for my emails' words might look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    time : 100\n",
    "    when : 100\n",
    "    meet : 99\n",
    "    thanks : 90\n",
    "    bike: 15\n",
    "    handlebar: 10\n",
    "    path: 10\n",
    "    lube: 4\n",
    "    chain: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use the tools of CountVectorizer to make some word vectors with data that preserves everything else you know about the words -- for instance, which speaker they relate to, when they were published, etc.  Along the way, we'll inspect the data so that you know what's being done to the word vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then apply the \"log likelihood\" calculation to these vectors to produce a score of what is most distinctive about each speaker's report.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### A word to those new to code\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are learning code for the first time, being able to recreate every single step along the way is far less important than getting a general feel for what the steps are:\n",
    "* cleaning (which you've seen before)\n",
    "* counting (which you've seen before)\n",
    "* vectorizing (this is new, but it's a lot like counting words)\n",
    "* working with vectors (to get them in the right format for statistical analysis)\n",
    "* statistical analysis (a loop that runs the log likelihood equation)\n",
    "* visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to pay attention to just a few new commands to see how they work:\n",
    "* CountVectorizer() -- to turn data into a vector \n",
    "* vectorizer.get_feature_names() -- to inspect a vector \n",
    "* vectorizer.todense -- to reformat a vector for future analysis\n",
    "* the for loop that runs the log likelihood equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, pay attention to what the most distinctive words look like for the corporations we sample, and how we use visualizations to interpret them. Think about how this might apply to your data challenge!\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few suggestions as you start on this week's notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will note that the str_replace() method of looking for words and phrases is REALLY slow: \n",
    "\n",
    "        df['Content'] = df['Content'].str.replace(pattern, \"\") \n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "  Don't be afraid to use the alternative code, which is hidden behind a comment (#):\n",
    "\n",
    "        df['Content'] = df['Content'].apply(lambda x: \" \".join(x for x in x.split() if x not in words_appear_once)) \n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "  We're not teaching the grammar of these variations, because they're deep Python rather than the easy syntax of pandas. But you are welcome to use them by copying and pasting!\n",
    "\n",
    "* As always, if you run into trouble around *import* functions, try \"installing\" the software package in question: \n",
    "      \n",
    "          !pip install [package] --user \n",
    "          \n",
    "        \n",
    "* There are at least two places where errors are supposed to occur: \n",
    "\n",
    "     (1) in the first few lines of loading EDGAR, where we drop or delete columns (really a cosmetic step, as I suggested in class). and \n",
    "        \n",
    "     (2) where I tell you to take the log of zero, which will produce an error because the log of zero is infinity.  \n",
    "    In both cases, you should read the commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that, let's dive in!"
