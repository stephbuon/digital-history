    "The process of extracting meaningful language patterns is an underlying challenge we face when performing any data-driven textual analysis. Here, this challenge is imagined as two-fold: analysts must determine which patterns are \"meaningful\" and analysts must apply the appropriate methods and tools to extract these meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which patterns are meaningful might not be immediately clear when working with an unfamiliar corpus, or when working with a familiar corpus that we realize has complexities beyond what we thought we knew about it. Deciding which language patterns are meaningful should therefore be a critical, iterative process. We must ask guiding questions and also evaluate the efficacy of these questions. What kinds of rabbit holes do our questions lead us down? Are there risks involved in the way we ask questions--risks such as distoring the subject matter at hand in order to confirm our own biases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts must also match guiding questions with an appropriate technique, while mindful that (like the higgs-whatever) (enter). Indeed, technique is crucial because our application of (a tool) will shape our analysis.(physics--can't measure--measurement changes--Karan barad) The same applies here. (ENTER).\n",

    "#### 2. Part-of-speech tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy tags parts-of-speech using a statistical model to predict which tag should most likely appear in a given context. Parts-of-speech are lexical categories that corresponds with a word's syntactic function--categories like \"adjective\" or \"verb.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Rule-based morphology\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphology refers to word form and how different forms relate to other words in a sentence. Consider the verbs \"write\" and \"writing\" in the following sentences: \n",
    "\n",
    "    \"I write programs.\"\n",
    "    \"I am writing a program.\"\n",

    "#### 4. Tokenization\n",
