    "In an earlier notebook we saw that the phrases \"the world\" and \"the house\" were particularly prevalent in Jane Austen's novels. How might we go about investigating how Austen imagined those realms?  One way might be to use a controlled vocabulary of words semantically linked to the landscape and the house to investigate how Austen talks about the surroundings of her characters."

Controlled Vocabularies have been used in digital history to examine the history of words used by Victorian people to describe the way that strangers walked down the street, and to show that novelists in the nineteenth century described the urban landscape with increasing detail.  \n",

You might need to slow down and revisit some of the \"optional\" notebooks that we mentioned in Weeks 1-2.  Here they are again:\n",

    "Also, please bear in mind that everyone who learns how to code ultimately does so through a lot of trial and error.  Try typing in code and running it. When you run into trouble, you can google your problems and find stack overflow results or blog entries that match your problem and suggest solutions.  The more you try, the faster you will master code.  \n",
