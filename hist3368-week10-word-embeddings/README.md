The Notebook, "Intro to scikit-learn (sklearn)" (hist3368-week10-word-embeddings.ipynb), was written by Dan Sinykin, Assistant Professor of English at Emory University. It was copied/forked from [sinykin](https://github.com/sinykin) at: [sinykin/QTM-340/notebooks/class10-sklearn-countvectorizer-inclass-ds.ipynb](https://github.com/sinykin/QTM-340/blob/master/notebooks/class10-sklearn-countvectorizer-inclass-ds.ipynb). 

Course-specific additions--specifically, additions that compare years and apply the code to environmental Congressional discourse post 1950--were made by Steph Buongiorno.
