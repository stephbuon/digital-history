    "# Hist 3368 - Week 5 - Working With Tabular Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "***by Jo Guldi***\n",
    "\n",
    "*Please note: This notebook requires at least **30GB** of memory. You may have to start a new HPC session.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, in this class we have worked with lists of words. We have cleaned them and counted and compared them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the class, we will be working with data in tables. Tables allow us to keep track of the date when each word is from. If we have time data, we can compare wordcounts over time, compare wordcounts for different speakers, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need a few special commands to navigate tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn to navigate tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * how to call a column\n",
    "   * how to move through a column, row by row, using a for loop\n",
    "   * how to subset or 'filter' data by a column, for example, finding all the speeches of one speaker:\n",
    "       * how to filter using square brackets -- **[ ]** \n",
    "       * the use of the operators **.isin()**, **==**, and **!=**.\n",
    "   * how to find the largest counts in a dataset using **.nlargest()**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will clean tabular data, with strategies we've seen before:\n",
    "   * stripping punctuation\n",
    "   * stopwording\n",
    "   * lemmatizing\n",
    "   * splitting into words (i.e. tokenization)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also learn some basics of counting with tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * how to count the words in a subset of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Research Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We will practice navigating around the tabular data for Congress, asking the kind of questions a researcher might want to know, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * given a set of years, who were the top speakers in Congress?\n",
    "   * given a speaker, what was his or her longest speech?\n",
    "   * given a certain set of words, who were the speakers who used those words the most?\n",
    "   \n",
    "The research questions profiled here are fairly simple, but if combined with strategies such as a *controlled vocabulary* they can result in a good deal of important information about which speakers were engaged with a particular topic -- for instance, the environment, crime, or women's health.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These research strategies can also help the researcher to navigate to the longest speeches where a speaker invokes those topics, or the speeches where the speaker invokes the highest number of words related to a particular topic.  Those research strategies should form the basis for guided reading.\n"

The race is the Texas water safari. marking its fifth year in 1967 with a 538mile race from San Marcos. by way of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers. along coastal bays and rivers. utilizing the Intracoastal Canal. to Freeport. Brave men from all over the countryand several entrants from foreign countries--will test their endurance. skill. equipment. plain physical stamina. and even luck as they brave logjams. rocks. white water. strong winds. and exhausting portages. on a journey through some of the most beautiful country in Texas. I am submitting today a concurrent resolution granting official recognition to the event. The race Is being sponsored by a nonprofit organization expressly set up for this purpose. Prizes approaching $6.500 in value are being donated. along with several fine trophies. I believe this outstanding sports event. emphasizing courage. skill. endurance. and physical fitness deserves official recognition. and I am hopeful that the Senate will agree and act with dispatch on the resolution. Mr. President. I ask that the text of the concurrent resolution be printed at this point in the RECORD. followed by a history of the Texas water safari. prepared by Mr. James Hurst of the safari.\n"

Twenty years ago Hawaii had nine pineapple companies. but this number has dwindled at an accelerating pace. Today there are only four left. The demise of another within a year has already been announced. Most recently. one of the remaining three said it will discontinue its operation on the Island of Molokai by 1975 or 1976. Another of the three also announced it will terminate its activities on Molokai. leaving the island virtually without any industry of any kind. The handwriting is on the wall. and we must anticipate that in a very short time there will be no pineapple canning industry left. The only thing remaining will be fresh pineapple. which will be grown on a limited basis. In 1950. Hawaii had 72 percent of world pineapple production. Now we have less than half that figure.
