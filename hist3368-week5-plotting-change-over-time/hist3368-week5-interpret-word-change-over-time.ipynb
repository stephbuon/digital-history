       "'says cochairman Russell. \"is an effort by private industry to cope with this critical problem and to encourage change of the unnatural pattern of white economic dominance in the Negro community.\" Cochairman Rodman C. Rockefeller. a vicepresident of the International Basic Economy Corporation. points out that ICBO also \"enables white businessmen to do something in addition to just contributing financially to the civil rights movement.\" IBM. for example. loaned one of its executives. Carter F. Henderson. to ICBO for seven months. paying his salary all the while he worked to set up ICBO as a going operation. PepsiCola loaned. on similar terms. its manager of special markets. Charles Dryden. for two months when ICBO suddenly became shortstaffed. \"Many businessmen.\" Rockefeller added. \"have been sitting on their hands. wondering how to participate. Now they are pitching in by doing what comes naturallypromoting good business.\" But promoting good business is not always easy. especially when racial distrust blocks the development of the confidence necessary to a consulting relationship. At an ICBO conference called to discuss what businessmen could do to help Negro small businessmen. a very important corporate person humphed. then said. \"Whats the big problem? So. a fellow needs a little help. he gives me a call and I tell him. come down and see me...\" A Negro businessman broke in. saying. \"This Negro is not coming downtown for another white mans handout.\" ICBOs consultants. as a result. go to the client wherever he may be. Even then. suspicion often lingers. Benjamin Goldstein. former president of Franklin Simon. a smart specialty chain. recalls his first visit as an ICBO consultant to a sportswear shop in Brooklyn owned by Floyd Ramsey and Jaime McDowell. two porters at New Yorks East Side Airlines Terminal. \"They were saying to me. cure me. and I was saying to them. show me your wounds. It took an hour before we were really able to talk to each other.\" The two proprietors obviously had good style sense. a very smart looking store. and ran an attractive operation. But there it was. right after Christmas. and they were about to lose the savings they had invested only a few short months ago. Though the shop had enjoyed a good holiday season. nothing much had moved since. And. the two owners needed cash for a spring line. They were running a sale. marking down their prices by five and 10 per cent. Goldstein told them they would never move their goods unless they slashed prices by 50 per cent. It was the kind of advice that makes green businessmen nervous. \"Frankly.\" Floyd Ramsey said later. \"we wondered whether the man came to put us in business or out of business.\" Today. the two men no longer wonder. Goldsteins advice started merchandise movIng. Working together. the three men set up inventory controls and a sales reporting system to enable them to tell what sold well and what did not. Jay Schwamm. a financier and former chairman of American Trust Company. was brought in as a financial consultant and he guided the two embryo businessmen through the intricacies involved in securing a business loan. The store has flourished. \"We are a nofee management consultant firm for small Negro businesses.\" John T. Patterson. ICBOs 38yearold national director. explained over an early breakfast. \"Thats the idea wed like to get across to our prospective clients. If a successful business can use outside consultants. there is no reason why they shouldnt. Whatever their problem may be. we try to find someone with the expertise in that area to assist them in solving that problem.\" He quickly added that all ICBO consultants are volunteers. Negro and white businessmen. including bank presidents. middle management and junior executives. accountants and lawyers. merchandising and other business experts. Often. more than one consultant Is called upon to help an ailing business or to start a new one. ICBO consultants. Patterson notes. \"get involved.\" One conservative bankertype once found himself painting a small store alongside his client and friends. Another ICBO consultant found that in order to save a husbandwife business. he had to patch up a marriage. \"So we do a little marriage counseling on the side.\" Patterson said. adding with a warm smile. \"actually. we dont encourage this activity.\" In its own quiet way. however. ICBO is as adventurous as openly militant civil rights organizations North and South. In June. 1965. the ICBO opened its Los Angeles office under cochairman Victor M. Carter. president of Republic Corporation. a film processor and appliance manufacturer. and Norman 0. Houston. Negro chairman of Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Co. The Los Angeles ICBO used the \"buddy system\"-pairing in established businessman consultant with a neophyte or businessman in troubleto good effect. A Negro in his midtwenties. for example. wanted to go Into the franchise rugcleaning business. He was working in a liquor store and had three years of college but he couldnt secure a loan to get started in business. He turned to ICBO and a volunteer consultant was impressed with his ambition and capability. The ICBO helped arrange a $2.300 bank loan that skirted some normal collateral requirements. The exliquor store employee has now set up his own business. The Los Angeles ICBO had all the cases it could handle. Then came Wattsa terrifying four days that saw 35 persons killed. 947 injured and 3.873 arrested. more than 900 buildings destroyed or damaged. an estimated $45 million lost in real estate and personal property and more than $1 million in emergency fire and police expenditures. Within a week after the riots. the ICBO opened a \"business assistance center\" in riottorn Watts. Haskell L. Lazere. western regional director of the American Jewish Congress. became the centers acting coordinator \"Our primary interest is helping Negro small businessmen get back into business or to get started in business.\" Lazere explained at the time. \"These businesses must be rebuilt or started to prevent the economy of the area from deteriorating further.\" Norman Houston said that he hoped that the Council eventually could find time to work toward eliminating overcharging. extremely high credit terms and other business malpractices that have infuriated the citizens of Watts. \"I have talked to residents.\" Houston said. \"and there are some businesses that would not be welcomed back Into the community.\" Within two weeks. 200 small businessmen came to the center seeking aid. And. they werent easy cases. \"Most riotaffected cases werent insured.\" says Lazere. \"and many of those wanting to start businesses. which make up half our cases. arent bankable. that is. they cant qualify for loans.\" Nonetheless. in short order. the Center found financing for six businesses. It also lined up financing for a Negro couple whose fivemonthold. modest but promising restaurant enterprise had turned into ashes in riot flames. An apparel company employee. out of work because his place of employment burned out. was launched in the haberdashery business through the center.'"

       "'Madam Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker. on October 9. the Congressional Budget Office pronounced that a tort reform or civil justice reform package would reduce the Federal budget deficit by an estimated $54 billion over 10 years. CBO recognizes that civil justice reforms also have an impact on the practice of defensive medicine. Defensive medicine is when doctors order more tests or procedures than are necessary just to protect themselves from frivolous lawsuits. Studies show that defensive medicine does not advance patients care or enhance a physicians capabilities. that billions of dollars in savings from tort reform could be used to provide health insurance for the uninsured without raising taxes on those who already have insurance policies. As the administration rushes to enact a massive government takeover of health care. Congress must remember that there is the option of saving between $54 billion and more than $200 billion by embracing tort reform. but it will take the leadership to stand up to personal injury lawyers instead of taxing Americans and cutting Medicare benefits. According to CBO. under the HEALTH Act. which includes tort reform. premiums for medical malpractice insurance ultimately would be an average of 25 percent to 30 percent below what they would be under current law. Also. the Government Accountability Office. GAO. found that rising litigation awards are responsible for skyrocketing medical professional liability premiums. The report stated that GAO found that losses on medical malpractice claimswhich make up the largest part of insurers costsappear to be the primary driver of rate increases in the long run. The GAO also concluded that insurer profits are not increasing. indicating that insurers are not charging and profiting from excessively high premium rates. and that in most States insurance regulators have the authority to deny premium rate increases they deem excessive. The reason the administration continues to refuse to add serious medical lawsuit reform to their health care legislation remains purely political. as was recently revealed by former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean. At a recent health care town hall meeting. Mr. Dean responded to an angry constituent who wondered why a supposedly comprehensive reform of the health care system doesnt include tort reform to lower costs of malpractice insurance and reduce defensive medicine. Mr. Dean responded. being remarkably candid. as follows: \"This is the answer from a doctor and a politician. Here is why tort reform is not in the bill. When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that. the more stuff you put in. the more enemies you make. right? And the reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. and that is the plain and simple truth.\" Medical malpractice premiums have risen more than 80 percent each year in some parts of the country and can cost almost half a million dollars a year in some specialties. Regarding the offer of HHS demonstration projectsand this is what the administration has proposedthat offer rings hollow given that the Cabinet Secretary tasked with implementing this proposal for demonstration projects is Kathleen Sebelius. Before she was Governor of Kansas and the Insurance Commissioner of Kansas. she spent 8 years as the head of the Kansas Trial Lawyers Association. now the Kansas Association for Justice. And she is also the State executive who. according to The New York Times. \"failed to make significant improvement in health coverage or costs during her two terms as Governor.\" The top contributor to President Obamas Presidential campaign was the legal industry. whose donations came to more than $43 million. More than 80 percent of the money given to Congress by lawyers. mostly from the plaintiffs bar. went to the Democratsalmost $22 million. More recently. when President Obama spoke to the American Medical Association in June of this year. he told the audience. \"Im not advocating caps on malpractice awards.\" But the American people are demanding legal reform. A recent survey found that 83 percent of Americans believe that reforming the legal system needs to be part of any health care reform plan. As the Associated Press recently reported. most Americans want Congress to deal with malpractice lawsuits driving up the costs of medical care. Yet. Democrats are reluctant to press forward on an issue that would upset a valuable political constituency. trial lawyers. even if President Barack Obama says hes open to changes. The AP poll found that 54 percent of Americans favor making it harder to sue doctors and hospitals for mistakes made while taking care of patients. Support for limits on malpractice lawsuits cuts across political lines. with 58 percent of Independents and 61 percent of Republicans in favor. Democrats are more divided. Still. 47 percent said they favor making it harder to sue. The survey was conducted by Stanford University with the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In the poll. 59 percent said they thought at least half the tests doctors order are unnecessary and ordered only because of fear of lawsuits. That is the end of the AP story. Madam Speaker. the USA Today editorial board also came out in support of tort reform. and USA Today wrote. A study last month by the Massachusetts Medical Society found that 83 percent of its doctors practice defensive medicine at a cost of at least $1.4 billion a year. Nationally. the cost is $60 billionplus every year. according to the Health and Human Services Departmentand thats the HHS of this administration. And a 2005 study in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that 93 percent of Pennsylvania doctors practice defensive medicine. The liability system is too often a lottery. excessive compensation is awarded to some patients and little or none to others. As much as 60 percent of awards are spent on attorneys. expert witnesses. and administrative expenses. The current system is arbitrary. inefficient. and results in years of delay. Madam Speaker. discussing the need for tort reform. the president of the American Medical Association said. If the health care bill doesnt have medical liability reform in it. then we dont see how it is going to be successful in controlling costs. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.'"

For example, a text split into single words (like our data frame in the previous example) is split into 1-grams (also just called \"tokens\"). 3-grams split the text into units that are 3 words long. 5-grams split the text into units that are 5 words long.
