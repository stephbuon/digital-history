    "# Hist 3368 - Week 5 - Working With Tabular Data in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, in this class we have worked with lists of words. We have cleaned them and counted and compared them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of the class, we will be working with data in tables. Tables allow us to keep track of the date when each word is from. If we have time data, we can compare wordcounts over time, compare wordcounts for different speakers, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need a few special commands to navigate tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn to navigate tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * how to call a column\n",
    "   * how to move through a column, row by row, using a for loop\n",
    "   * how to stopword\n",
    "   * how to subset or 'filter' data by a column, for example, finding all the speeches of one speaker, or all the speeches on a certain date, using square brackets -- **[ ]** -- and the operators **.isin()**, **==**, and **!=**.\n",
    "   * how to find the largest counts in a dataset using **.nlargest()**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also learn some basics of counting with tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * how to count the words in a subset of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Research Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We will practice navigating around the tabular data for Congress, asking the kind of questions a researcher might want to know, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * given a set of years, who were the top speakers in Congress?\n",
    "   * given a speaker, what was his or her longest speech?\n",
    "   * given a certain set of words, who were the speakers who used those words the most?\n",
    "   \n",
    "The research questions profiled here are fairly simple, but if combined with strategies such as a *controlled vocabulary* they can result in a good deal of important information about which speakers were engaged with a particular topic -- for instance, the environment, crime, or women's health.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These research strategies can also help the researcher to navigate to the longest speeches where a speaker invokes those topics, or the speeches where the speaker invokes the highest number of words related to a particular topic.  Those research strategies should form the basis for guided reading.\n"

Brave men from all over the countryand several entrants from foreign countries--will test their endurance. skill. equipment. plain physical stamina. and even luck as they brave logjams. rocks. white water. strong winds. and exhausting portages. on a journey through some of the most beautiful country in Texas. I am submitting today a concurrent resolution granting official recognition to the event. The race Is being sponsored by a nonprofit organization expressly set up for this purpose. Prizes approaching $6.500 in value are being donated. along with several fine trophies. I believe this outstanding sports event. emphasizing courage. skill. endurance. and physical fitness deserves official recognition. and I am hopeful that the Senate will agree and act with dispatch on the resolution. Mr. President. I ask that the text of the concurrent resolution be printed at this point in the RECORD. followed by a history of the Texas water safari. prepared by Mr. James Hurst of the safari.\n"

      "Mr. President. I am introducing legislation today to enable Hawaiian pineapple products to compete in the U.S. market with lowcost foreign canned pineapple which can easily undersell Hawaiian pineapple. One of the finest products in all America is the sweet. juicy. delectable pineapple grown in Hawaii. Since the turn of the century. pineapple has been a mainstay in Hawaiis economy. Today it is still my States second largest agricultural industay. second only to sugar. The processed value of Hawaiian pineapple last year was $137 million. The industry employs 6.200 yearround workers who earned $42 million in annual wages and another 12.000 seasonal workers who earn a total of $10 million a year. Hawaiis pineapple industry has been very energetic and progressive. investing millions of its own dollars in research to improve pineapple quality and production. The Hawaiian pineapple industry is the most highly mechanized In the world and its fleldworkers are the highest paid in the world. The\n"
