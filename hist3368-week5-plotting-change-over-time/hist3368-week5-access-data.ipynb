    "These are the section names for the data:\n",
    "- EDGAR Database\n",
    "- Hansard (UK Parliament)\n",
    "- US Congress\n",
    "- Reddit Archive\n",
    "- Dallas and Houston City Council Minutes\n",
    "- NovelTM Datasets for English-Language Fiction, 1700-2009 (preferred source for c19 Novels)\n",
    "- Project Gutenberg (backup source for c19 Novels)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Many of the datasets include exercises for applying what we have learned from previous lessons -- for example, word clouds, word count, etc.  You should study these examples.  Pay particular attention to the REDDIT example as it is the most developed.*\n",

    "Some datasets are large enough that they will require larger memory allocations for successful work. Pay attention to anything that makes the kernel crash. If you experience this, start a new session with more memory.  The notes below hold clues about how much memory you might need.\n",

    "#### Your Second Job Today is to Inspect Your Data.  What do the columns hold?\n",

    "The final assignment asks you to apply some of what you have learned about working with tabular data.  To execute this assignment, you will need to **inspect** your data to understand what the column names mean.  \n",
    "- Identify the *text* column in your dataset -- which is called 'speech' in some datasets, 'data' in others, 'body' in some, and 'text' in others.  \n",
    "- You will also need to identify the *contributor* column -- which may be listed as the 'speaker,' 'author,' or something else.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your Third Job Today is to Apply What You Have Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "The final assigment asks you to find the longest pieces of text in your dataset, their contributors, and to count the words in the longest pieces of text.  You will need to borrow code from previous problem sets to make this work. \n",
    "\n",
    "To borrow code successfully, you will need to make sure that the names of the columns match -- for instance, if the name of your text column is 'body,' you will have to change the problem set code where it calls the column 'speech.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic commands you will use -- .count(), .replace(), .str.split().explode().dropna().value_counts() -- will be exactly the same for your assignment as they were in the previous problem sets."
